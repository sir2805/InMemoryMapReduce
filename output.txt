these	1
words	1

greeted	1

used	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
elite	1
all	1
her	1
invitations	1
without	1
exception	1
written	1
in	1
french	1
and	1
delivered	1
by	1
a	1
scarletliveried	1
footman	1
that	1
morning	1
ran	1
as	1
follows	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
nothing	1
better	1
to	1
do	1
count	1
or	1
prince	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
spending	1
an	1
evening	1
with	1
a	1
poor	1
invalid	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
terrible	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
charmed	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
tonight	1
between	1
and	1
annette	1
schrer	1
heavens	1
what	1
a	1
virulent	1
attack	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
this	1
reception	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
entered	1
wearing	1
an	1
embroidered	1
court	1
uniform	1
knee	1
breeches	1
and	1
shoes	1
and	1
had	1
stars	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
a	1
serene	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
flat	1
face	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
that	1
refined	1
french	1
in	1
which	1
our	1
grandfathers	1
not	1
only	1
spoke	1
but	1
thought	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
gentle	1
patronizing	1
intonation	1
natural	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
importance	1
who	1
had	1
grown	1
old	1
in	1
society	1
and	1
at	1
court	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
presenting	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
bald	1
scented	1
and	1
shining	1
head	1
and	1
complacently	1
seated	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
dear	1
friend	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
are	1
set	1
your	1
friends	1
mind	1
at	1
rest	1
said	1
he	1
without	1
altering	1
his	1
tone	1
beneath	1
the	1
politeness	1
and	1
affected	1
sympathy	1
of	1
which	1
indifference	1
and	1
even	1
irony	1
could	1
be	1
discerned	1
can	1
one	1
be	1
well	1
while	1
suffering	1
morally	1
can	1
one	1
be	1
calm	1
in	1
times	1
like	1
these	1
if	1
one	1
has	1
any	1
feeling	1
said	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
you	1
are	1
staying	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
i	1
hope	1
and	1
the	1
fete	1
at	1
the	1
english	1
ambassadors	1
today	1
is	1
wednesday	1
i	1
must	1
put	1
in	1
an	1
appearance	1
there	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
my	1
daughter	1
is	1
coming	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
there	1
i	1
thought	1
todays	1
fete	1
had	1
been	1
canceled	1
i	1
confess	1
all	1
these	1
festivities	1
and	1
fireworks	1
are	1
becoming	1
wearisome	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
you	1
wished	1
it	1
the	1
entertainment	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
off	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
who	1
like	1
a	1
woundup	1
clock	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
said	1
things	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
believed	1
dont	1
tease	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
decided	1
about	1
novosltsevs	1
dispatch	1
you	1
know	1
everything	1
what	1
can	1
one	1
say	1
about	1
it	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
listless	1
tone	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
decided	1
they	1
have	1
decided	1
that	1
buonaparte	1
has	1
burnt	1
his	1
boats	1
and	1
i	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
burn	1
ours	1
prince	1
vasli	1
always	1
spoke	1
languidly	1
like	1
an	1
actor	1
repeating	1
a	1
stale	1
part	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
schrer	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
despite	1
her	1
forty	1
years	1
overflowed	1
with	1
animation	1
and	1
impulsiveness	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
enthusiast	1
had	1
become	1
her	1
social	1
vocation	1
and	1
sometimes	1
even	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
like	1
it	1
she	1
became	1
enthusiastic	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
disappoint	1
the	1
expectations	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
her	1
the	1
subdued	1
smile	1
which	1
though	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
suit	1
her	1
faded	1
features	1
always	1
played	1
round	1
her	1
lips	1
expressed	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
spoiled	1
child	1
a	1
continual	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
charming	1
defect	1
which	1
she	1
neither	1
wished	1
nor	1
could	1
nor	1
considered	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
correct	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
on	1
political	1
matters	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
burst	1
out	1
oh	1
dont	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
austria	1
perhaps	1
i	1
dont	1
understand	1
things	1
but	1
austria	1
never	1
has	1
wished	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
wish	1
for	1
war	1
she	1
is	1
betraying	1
us	1
russia	1
alone	1
must	1
save	1
europe	1
our	1
gracious	1
sovereign	1
recognizes	1
his	1
high	1
vocation	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
i	1
have	1
faith	1
in	1
our	1
good	1
and	1
wonderful	1
sovereign	1
has	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
noblest	1
role	1
on	1
earth	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
virtuous	1
and	1
noble	1
that	1
god	1
will	1
not	1
forsake	1
him	1
he	1
will	1
fulfill	1
his	1
vocation	1
and	1
crush	1
the	1
hydra	1
of	1
revolution	1
which	1
has	1
become	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
this	1
murderer	1
and	1
villain	1
we	1
alone	1
must	1
avenge	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
one	1
whom	1
i	1
ask	1
you	1
can	1
we	1
rely	1
on	1
england	1
with	1
her	1
commercial	1
spirit	1
will	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
emperor	1
alexanders	1
loftiness	1
of	1
soul	1
she	1
has	1
refused	1
to	1
evacuate	1
malta	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
find	1
and	1
still	1
seeks	1
some	1
secret	1
motive	1
in	1
our	1
actions	1
what	1
answer	1
did	1
novosltsev	1
get	1
none	1
the	1
english	1
have	1
not	1
understood	1
and	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
selfabnegation	1
of	1
our	1
emperor	1
who	1
wants	1
nothing	1
for	1
himself	1
but	1
only	1
desires	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
mankind	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
they	1
promised	1
nothing	1
and	1
what	1
little	1
they	1
have	1
promised	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
perform	1
prussia	1
has	1
always	1
declared	1
that	1
buonaparte	1
is	1
invincible	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
europe	1
is	1
powerless	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
i	1
dont	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
that	1
hardenburg	1
says	1
or	1
haugwitz	1
either	1
this	1
famous	1
prussian	1
neutrality	1
is	1
just	1
a	1
trap	1
i	1
have	1
faith	1
only	1
in	1
god	1
and	1
the	1
lofty	1
destiny	1
of	1
our	1
adored	1
monarch	1
he	1
will	1
save	1
europe	1
she	1
suddenly	1
paused	1
smiling	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
impetuosity	1
i	1
think	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
instead	1
of	1
our	1
dear	1
wintzingerode	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
captured	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
prussias	1
consent	1
by	1
assault	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
eloquent	1
will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
propos	1
she	1
added	1
becoming	1
calm	1
again	1
i	1
am	1
expecting	1
two	1
very	1
interesting	1
men	1
tonight	1
le	1
vicomte	1
de	1
mortemart	1
who	1
is	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
montmorencys	1
through	1
the	1
rohans	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
french	1
families	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
genuine	1
migrs	1
the	1
good	1
ones	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
abb	1
morio	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
profound	1
thinker	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
received	1
by	1
the	1
emperor	1
had	1
you	1
heard	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
but	1
tell	1
me	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
studied	1
carelessness	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
though	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ask	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
motive	1
of	1
his	1
visit	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
dowager	1
empress	1
wants	1
baron	1
funke	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
first	1
secretary	1
at	1
vienna	1
the	1
baron	1
by	1
all	1
accounts	1
is	1
a	1
poor	1
creature	1
prince	1
vasli	1
wished	1
to	1
obtain	1
this	1
post	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
but	1
others	1
were	1
trying	1
through	1
the	1
dowager	1
empress	1
mrya	1
fdorovna	1
to	1
secure	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
baron	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
almost	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
anyone	1
else	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
criticize	1
what	1
the	1
empress	1
desired	1
or	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
baron	1
funke	1
has	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
dowager	1
empress	1
by	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
and	1
mournful	1
tone	1
as	1
she	1
named	1
the	1
empress	1
anna	1
pvlovnas	1
face	1
suddenly	1
assumed	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
profound	1
and	1
sincere	1
devotion	1
and	1
respect	1
mingled	1
with	1
sadness	1
and	1
this	1
occurred	1
every	1
time	1
she	1
mentioned	1
her	1
illustrious	1
patroness	1
she	1
added	1
that	1
her	1
majesty	1
had	1
deigned	1
to	1
show	1
baron	1
funke	1
beaucoup	1
destime	1
and	1
again	1
her	1
face	1
clouded	1
over	1
with	1
sadness	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
looked	1
indifferent	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
womanly	1
and	1
courtierlike	1
quickness	1
and	1
tact	1
habitual	1
to	1
her	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
wished	1
both	1
to	1
rebuke	1
him	1
for	1
daring	1
to	1
speak	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
empress	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
console	1
him	1
so	1
she	1
said	1
now	1
about	1
your	1
family	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
your	1
daughter	1
came	1
out	1
everyone	1
has	1
been	1
enraptured	1
by	1
her	1
they	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
amazingly	1
beautiful	1
the	1
prince	1
bowed	1
to	1
signify	1
his	1
respect	1
and	1
gratitude	1
i	1
often	1
think	1
she	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
smiling	1
amiably	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
political	1
and	1
social	1
topics	1
were	1
ended	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
intimate	1
conversationi	1
often	1
think	1
how	1
unfairly	1
sometimes	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
life	1
are	1
distributed	1
why	1
has	1
fate	1
given	1
you	1
two	1
such	1
splendid	1
children	1
i	1
dont	1
speak	1
of	1
anatole	1
your	1
youngest	1
i	1
dont	1
like	1
him	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
admitting	1
of	1
no	1
rejoinder	1
and	1
raising	1
her	1
eyebrows	1
two	1
such	1
charming	1
children	1
and	1
really	1
you	1
appreciate	1
them	1
less	1
than	1
anyone	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
dont	1
deserve	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
and	1
she	1
smiled	1
her	1
ecstatic	1
smile	1
i	1
cant	1
help	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
lavater	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
i	1
lack	1
the	1
bump	1
of	1
paternity	1
dont	1
joke	1
i	1
mean	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
serious	1
talk	1
with	1
you	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
am	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
your	1
younger	1
son	1
between	1
ourselves	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
assumed	1
its	1
melancholy	1
expression	1
he	1
was	1
mentioned	1
at	1
her	1
majestys	1
and	1
you	1
were	1
pitied	1
the	1
prince	1
answered	1
nothing	1
but	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
significantly	1
awaiting	1
a	1
reply	1
he	1
frowned	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
me	1
do	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
did	1
all	1
a	1
father	1
could	1
for	1
their	1
education	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
both	1
turned	1
out	1
fools	1
hippolyte	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
quiet	1
fool	1
but	1
anatole	1
is	1
an	1
active	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
difference	1
between	1
them	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
smiling	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
more	1
natural	1
and	1
animated	1
than	1
usual	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
round	1
his	1
mouth	1
very	1
clearly	1
revealed	1
something	1
unexpectedly	1
coarse	1
and	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
why	1
are	1
children	1
born	1
to	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
father	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
i	1
could	1
reproach	1
you	1
with	1
said	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
looking	1
up	1
pensively	1
i	1
am	1
your	1
faithful	1
slave	1
and	1
to	1
you	1
alone	1
i	1
can	1
confess	1
that	1
my	1
children	1

a	1
delicate	1
dark	1
down	1
was	1
just	1
perceptible	1
was	1
too	1
short	1
for	1
her	1

it	1
lifted	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
sweetly	1
and	1
was	1
especially	1
charming	1
when	1
she	1
occasionally	1
drew	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
lower	1
lip	1
as	1
is	1
always	1
the	1

with	1

brightened	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
pretty	1
young	1
woman	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
mother	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
health	1
and	1
carrying	1
her	1
burden	1
so	1
lightly	1
old	1
men	1
and	1
dull	1
dispirited	1
young	1
ones	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
after	1
being	1
in	1
her	1
company	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
too	1
were	1
becoming	1
like	1
her	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
health	1
all	1
who	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
at	1
each	1
word	1
saw	1
her	1
bright	1
smile	1
and	1
the	1
constant	1
gleam	1
of	1
her	1
white	1
teeth	1
thought	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
specially	1
amiable	1
mood	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
went	1
round	1

her	1
workbag	1
on	1
her	1

spreading	1
out	1
her	1

sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1

near	1
the	1
silver	1
samovar	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
she	1

the	1

in	1
the	1

tone	1
of	1

still	1
in	1

added	1
addressing	1
prince	1
vasli	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
the	1
beautiful	1
hlne	1
what	1
a	1
delightful	1
woman	1
this	1

pvlovna	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
arrivals	1
was	1
a	1
stout	1
heavily	1
built	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
closecropped	1
hair	1
spectacles	1
the	1
lightcolored	1
breeches	1
fashionable	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
ruffle	1
and	1
a	1
brown	1
dress	1
coat	1
this	1
stout	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
of	1
count	1
bezkhov	1
a	1
wellknown	1
grandee	1
of	1
catherines	1
time	1
who	1
now	1
lay	1
dying	1
in	1
moscow	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
entered	1
either	1
the	1
military	1
or	1
civil	1
service	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
first	1
appearance	1
in	1
society	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
greeted	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
nod	1
she	1
accorded	1
to	1
the	1
lowest	1
hierarchy	1
in	1
her	1
drawing	1
room	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
lowestgrade	1
greeting	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fear	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
something	1
too	1
large	1
and	1
unsuited	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
pierre	1
enter	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
certainly	1
rather	1
bigger	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
her	1
anxiety	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
clever	1
though	1
shy	1
but	1
observant	1
and	1
natural	1
expression	1
which	1
distinguished	1
him	1
from	1
everyone	1
else	1
in	1
that	1
drawing	1
room	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
you	1
monsieur	1
pierre	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
visit	1
a	1
poor	1
invalid	1
said	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
exchanging	1
an	1
alarmed	1
glance	1
with	1
her	1
aunt	1
as	1
she	1
conducted	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
pierre	1
murmured	1
something	1
unintelligible	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
something	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
aunt	1
he	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
pleased	1
smile	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
intimate	1
acquaintance	1
anna	1
pvlovnas	1
alarm	1
was	1
justified	1
for	1
pierre	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
aunt	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
speech	1
about	1
her	1
majestys	1
health	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
in	1
dismay	1
detained	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
words	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
abb	1
morio	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
man	1
yes	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
scheme	1
for	1
perpetual	1
peace	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
but	1
hardly	1
feasible	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
rejoined	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
and	1
get	1
away	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess	1
but	1
pierre	1
now	1
committed	1
a	1
reverse	1
act	1
of	1
impoliteness	1
first	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
a	1
lady	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
another	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
bent	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
feet	1
spread	1
apart	1
he	1
began	1
explaining	1
his	1
reasons	1
for	1
thinking	1
the	1
abbs	1
plan	1
chimerical	1
we	1
will	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
later	1
said	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
having	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
behave	1
she	1
resumed	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
watch	1
ready	1
to	1
help	1
at	1
any	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
conversation	1
might	1
happen	1
to	1
flag	1
as	1
the	1
foreman	1
of	1
a	1
spinning	1
mill	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
set	1
the	1
hands	1
to	1
work	1
goes	1
round	1
and	1
notices	1
here	1
a	1
spindle	1
that	1
has	1
stopped	1
or	1
there	1
one	1
that	1
creaks	1
or	1
makes	1
more	1
noise	1
than	1
it	1
should	1
and	1
hastens	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
machine	1
or	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
proper	1
motion	1
so	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
moved	1
about	1
her	1
drawing	1
room	1
approaching	1
now	1
a	1
silent	1
now	1
a	1
toonoisy	1
group	1
and	1

on	1

at	1

still	1

on	1

she	1
readjusted	1

from	1

smoothed	1
the	1

just	1
the	1
expression	1

again	1
relapsed	1

radiant	1

smiling	1
and	1
talking	1
merrily	1
to	1
everyone	1
at	1
once	1
sat	1
down	1

to	1

himself	1
beside	1

le	1
charmant	1
hippolyte	1
was	1
surprising	1
by	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
resemblance	1
to	1
his	1
beautiful	1
sister	1
but	1
yet	1
more	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
resemblance	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
ugly	1
his	1
features	1
were	1
like	1
his	1
sisters	1
but	1
while	1
in	1
her	1
case	1
everything	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
joyous	1
selfsatisfied	1
youthful	1
and	1
constant	1
smile	1
of	1
animation	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
wonderful	1
classic	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
figure	1
his	1
face	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
was	1
dulled	1
by	1
imbecility	1
and	1
a	1
constant	1
expression	1
of	1
sullen	1
selfconfidence	1
while	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
thin	1
and	1
weak	1
his	1
eyes	1
nose	1
and	1
mouth	1
all	1
seemed	1
puckered	1
into	1
a	1
vacant	1
wearied	1
grimace	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
always	1
fell	1
into	1
unnatural	1
positions	1

not	1
going	1
to	1
be	1

said	1
he	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
hastily	1
adjusting	1
his	1
lorgnette	1
as	1
if	1
without	1
this	1
instrument	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
why	1
no	1

the	1
astonished	1
narrator	1
shrugging	1
his	1

in	1
a	1
tone	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1

only	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
uttered	1
them	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
such	1
selfconfidence	1
that	1
his	1
hearers	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
sure	1
whether	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
very	1
witty	1
or	1
very	1
stupid	1

he	1
called	1

the	1
vicomte	1
told	1
his	1
tale	1
very	1
neatly	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
anecdote	1
then	1
current	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
the	1
duc	1
denghien	1
had	1
gone	1
secretly	1
to	1
paris	1
to	1
visit	1
mademoiselle	1
george	1
that	1
at	1
her	1
house	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
bonaparte	1
who	1
also	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
famous	1
actress	1
favors	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
napoleon	1
happened	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fainting	1
fits	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
subject	1
and	1
was	1
thus	1
at	1
the	1
ducs	1
mercy	1
the	1
latter	1
spared	1
him	1
and	1
this	1
magnanimity	1
bonaparte	1
subsequently	1
repaid	1
by	1
death	1
the	1
story	1
was	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
interesting	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
rivals	1
suddenly	1
recognized	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
looked	1
agitated	1

testify	1
that	1
the	1
interest	1
and	1
fascination	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
going	1
on	1
with	1
it	1
the	1

appreciated	1
this	1
silent	1
praise	1

smiling	1
gratefully	1
prepared	1

just	1
then	1
anna	1

kept	1
a	1
watchful	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
so	1
alarmed	1
her	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
too	1
loudly	1
and	1
vehemently	1
with	1
the	1
abb	1
so	1
she	1
hurried	1
to	1
the	1
rescue	1

managed	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1

explaining	1

theory	1
both	1
were	1
talking	1

listening	1
too	1
eagerly	1

too	1
naturally	1

up	1

habitual	1
to	1

when	1
conversing	1
with	1

by	1
