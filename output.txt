the	1
infamies	1
and	1
horrors	1
perpetrated	1
by	1
that	1
antichristi	1

how	1

you	1
do	1
i	1
see	1
i	1
have	1
frightened	1
yousit	1
down	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
news	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
july	1
and	1
the	1
speaker	1
was	1
the	1
wellknown	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
schrer	1
maid	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
favorite	1
of	1
the	1
empress	1
mrya	1
fdorovna	1
with	1
these	1
words	1
she	1
greeted	1
prince	1
vasli	1
kurgin	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
high	1
rank	1
and	1
importance	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
her	1
reception	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
cough	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
suffering	1
from	1
la	1
grippe	1
grippe	1
being	1
then	1
a	1
new	1
word	1
in	1
st	1
petersburg	1
used	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
elite	1
all	1
her	1
invitations	1
without	1
exception	1
written	1
in	1
french	1
and	1
delivered	1
by	1
a	1
scarletliveried	1
footman	1
that	1
morning	1
ran	1
as	1
follows	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
nothing	1
better	1
to	1
do	1
count	1
or	1
prince	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
spending	1
an	1
evening	1
with	1
a	1
poor	1
invalid	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
terrible	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
charmed	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
tonight	1
between	1
and	1
annette	1
schrer	1
heavens	1
what	1
a	1
virulent	1
attack	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
this	1
reception	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
entered	1
wearing	1
an	1
embroidered	1
court	1
uniform	1
knee	1
breeches	1
and	1
shoes	1
and	1
had	1
stars	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
a	1
serene	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
flat	1
face	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
that	1
refined	1
french	1
in	1
which	1
our	1
grandfathers	1
not	1
only	1
spoke	1
but	1
thought	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
gentle	1
patronizing	1
intonation	1
natural	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
importance	1
who	1
had	1
grown	1
old	1
in	1
society	1
and	1
at	1
court	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
presenting	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
bald	1
scented	1
and	1
shining	1
head	1
and	1
complacently	1
seated	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
dear	1
friend	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
are	1
set	1
your	1
friends	1
mind	1
at	1
rest	1
said	1
he	1
without	1
altering	1
his	1
tone	1
beneath	1
the	1
politeness	1
and	1
affected	1
sympathy	1
of	1
which	1
indifference	1
and	1
even	1
irony	1
could	1
be	1
discerned	1
can	1
one	1
be	1
well	1
while	1
suffering	1
morally	1
can	1
one	1
be	1
calm	1
in	1
times	1
like	1
these	1
if	1
one	1
has	1
any	1
feeling	1
said	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
you	1
are	1
staying	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
i	1
hope	1
and	1
the	1
fete	1
at	1
the	1
english	1
ambassadors	1
today	1
is	1
wednesday	1
i	1
must	1
put	1
in	1
an	1
appearance	1
there	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
my	1
daughter	1
is	1
coming	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
there	1
i	1
thought	1
todays	1
fete	1
had	1
been	1
canceled	1
i	1
confess	1
all	1
these	1
festivities	1
and	1
fireworks	1
are	1
becoming	1
wearisome	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
you	1
wished	1
it	1
the	1
entertainment	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
off	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
who	1
like	1
a	1
woundup	1
clock	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
said	1
things	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
believed	1
dont	1
tease	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
decided	1
about	1
novosltsevs	1
dispatch	1
you	1
know	1
everything	1
what	1
can	1
one	1
say	1
about	1
it	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
listless	1
tone	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
decided	1
they	1
have	1
decided	1
that	1
buonaparte	1
has	1
burnt	1
his	1
boats	1
and	1
i	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
burn	1
ours	1
prince	1
vasli	1
always	1
spoke	1
languidly	1
like	1
an	1
actor	1
repeating	1
a	1
stale	1
part	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
schrer	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
despite	1
her	1
forty	1
years	1
overflowed	1
with	1
animation	1
and	1
impulsiveness	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
enthusiast	1
had	1
become	1
her	1
social	1
vocation	1
and	1
sometimes	1
even	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
like	1
it	1
she	1
became	1
enthusiastic	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
disappoint	1
the	1
expectations	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
her	1
the	1
subdued	1
smile	1
which	1
though	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
suit	1
her	1
faded	1
features	1
always	1
played	1
round	1
her	1
lips	1
expressed	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
spoiled	1
child	1
a	1
continual	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
charming	1
defect	1
which	1
she	1
neither	1
wished	1
nor	1
could	1
nor	1
considered	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
correct	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
on	1
political	1
matters	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
burst	1
out	1
oh	1
dont	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
austria	1
perhaps	1
i	1
dont	1
understand	1
things	1
but	1
austria	1
never	1
has	1
wished	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
wish	1
for	1
war	1
she	1
is	1
betraying	1
us	1
russia	1
alone	1
must	1
save	1
europe	1
our	1
gracious	1
sovereign	1
recognizes	1
his	1
high	1
vocation	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
i	1
have	1
faith	1
in	1
our	1
good	1
and	1
wonderful	1
sovereign	1
has	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
noblest	1
role	1
on	1
earth	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
virtuous	1
and	1
noble	1
that	1
god	1
will	1
not	1
forsake	1
him	1
he	1
will	1
fulfill	1
his	1
vocation	1
and	1
crush	1
the	1
hydra	1
of	1
revolution	1
which	1
has	1
become	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
ever	1
in	1

the	1
selfabnegation	1
of	1
our	1

who	1
wants	1
nothing	1
for	1
himself	1
but	1
only	1
desires	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
mankind	1

she	1
suddenly	1
paused	1
smiling	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
impetuosity	1
i	1
think	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
instead	1
of	1
our	1
dear	1

you	1
would	1
have	1
captured	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
prussias	1
consent	1
by	1
assault	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
eloquent	1
will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1

she	1
added	1
becoming	1

again	1
i	1

also	1
the	1

you	1

profound	1
thinker	1
he	1

i	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
but	1
tell	1
me	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
studied	1
carelessness	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
though	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ask	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
motive	1
of	1
his	1
visit	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
dowager	1
empress	1
wants	1
baron	1
funke	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
first	1
secretary	1
at	1
vienna	1
the	1
baron	1
by	1

a	1
poor	1
creature	1
prince	1
vasli	1
wished	1
to	1
obtain	1
this	1
post	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
but	1
others	1
were	1
trying	1
through	1
the	1
dowager	1
empress	1
mrya	1
fdorovna	1
to	1
secure	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
baron	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
almost	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
anyone	1
else	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
criticize	1
what	1
the	1
empress	1
desired	1
or	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
baron	1
funke	1
has	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
dowager	1
empress	1
by	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
and	1
mournful	1
tone	1
as	1
she	1
named	1
the	1
empress	1
anna	1
pvlovnas	1
face	1
suddenly	1
assumed	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
profound	1
and	1
sincere	1
devotion	1
and	1
respect	1
mingled	1
with	1
sadness	1
and	1
this	1
occurred	1
every	1
time	1
she	1
mentioned	1
her	1
illustrious	1
patroness	1
she	1
added	1
that	1
her	1
majesty	1
had	1
deigned	1
to	1
show	1
baron	1
funke	1
beaucoup	1
destime	1
and	1
again	1
her	1
face	1
clouded	1
over	1
with	1
sadness	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
looked	1
indifferent	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
womanly	1
and	1
courtierlike	1
quickness	1
and	1
tact	1
habitual	1
to	1
her	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
wished	1
both	1
to	1
rebuke	1
him	1
for	1
daring	1
to	1
speak	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
empress	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
console	1
him	1
so	1
she	1
said	1
now	1
about	1
your	1
family	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
your	1
daughter	1
came	1
out	1
everyone	1
has	1
been	1
enraptured	1
by	1
her	1
they	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
amazingly	1
beautiful	1
the	1
prince	1
bowed	1
to	1
signify	1
his	1
respect	1
and	1
gratitude	1
i	1
often	1
think	1
she	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
smiling	1
amiably	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
political	1
and	1
social	1
topics	1
were	1
ended	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
intimate	1
conversationi	1
often	1
think	1
how	1
unfairly	1
sometimes	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
life	1
are	1
distributed	1
why	1
has	1
fate	1
given	1
you	1
two	1
such	1
splendid	1
children	1
i	1
dont	1
speak	1
of	1
anatole	1
your	1
youngest	1
i	1
dont	1
like	1
him	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
admitting	1
of	1
no	1
rejoinder	1
and	1
raising	1
her	1
eyebrows	1
two	1
such	1
charming	1
children	1
and	1
really	1
you	1
appreciate	1
them	1
less	1
than	1
anyone	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
dont	1
deserve	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
and	1
she	1
smiled	1
her	1
ecstatic	1
smile	1
i	1
cant	1
help	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
lavater	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
i	1
lack	1
the	1
bump	1
of	1
paternity	1
dont	1
joke	1
i	1
mean	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
serious	1
talk	1
with	1
you	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
am	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
your	1
younger	1
son	1
between	1
ourselves	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
assumed	1
its	1
melancholy	1
expression	1
he	1
was	1
mentioned	1
at	1
her	1
majestys	1
and	1
you	1
were	1
pitied	1
the	1
prince	1
answered	1
nothing	1
but	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
significantly	1
awaiting	1
a	1
reply	1
he	1
frowned	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
me	1
do	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
did	1
all	1
a	1
father	1
could	1
for	1
their	1
education	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
both	1
turned	1
out	1
fools	1
hippolyte	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
quiet	1
fool	1
but	1
anatole	1
is	1
an	1
active	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
difference	1
between	1
them	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
smiling	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
more	1
natural	1
and	1
animated	1
than	1
usual	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
round	1
his	1
mouth	1
very	1
clearly	1
revealed	1
something	1
unexpectedly	1
coarse	1
and	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
why	1
are	1
children	1
born	1
to	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
father	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
i	1
could	1
reproach	1
you	1
with	1
said	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
looking	1
up	1
pensively	1
i	1
am	1
your	1
faithful	1
slave	1
and	1
to	1
you	1
alone	1
i	1
can	1
confess	1
that	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
the	1
bane	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
cross	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
bear	1
that	1
is	1
how	1
i	1
explain	1
it	1
to	1
myself	1
it	1
cant	1
be	1
helped	1
he	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
but	1
expressed	1
his	1
resignation	1
to	1
cruel	1
fate	1
by	1
a	1
gesture	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
meditated	1
have	1
you	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
marrying	1
your	1
prodigal	1
son	1
anatole	1
she	1
asked	1
they	1
say	1
old	1
maids	1
have	1
a	1
mania	1
for	1
matchmaking	1
and	1
though	1
i	1
dont	1
feel	1
that	1
weakness	1
in	1
myself	1
as	1
yet	1
i	1

a	1
little	1

not	1

with	1
the	1
quickness	1
of	1
memory	1
and	1
perception	1
befitting	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
indicated	1
by	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
considering	1
this	1
information	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
sad	1
current	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts	1
that	1
anatole	1
is	1
costing	1
me	1
forty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
what	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
five	1
years	1
if	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1

at	1
the	1

so	1
soon	1
to	1

a	1

the	1

of	1

this	1

was	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
of	1

a	1
wellknown	1
grandee	1
of	1

the	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
entered	1
either	1
the	1
military	1
or	1
civil	1
service	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1

this	1
was	1
his	1
first	1
appearance	1
in	1

anna	1
pvlovna	1
greeted	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
nod	1
she	1
accorded	1
to	1
the	1
lowest	1
hierarchy	1
in	1
her	1
drawing	1
room	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
lowestgrade	1
greeting	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fear	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
something	1
too	1
large	1
and	1
unsuited	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
pierre	1
enter	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
certainly	1
rather	1
bigger	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
her	1
anxiety	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
clever	1
though	1
shy	1
but	1
observant	1
and	1
natural	1
expression	1
which	1
distinguished	1
him	1
from	1
everyone	1
else	1
in	1
that	1
drawing	1
room	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
you	1
monsieur	1
pierre	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
visit	1
a	1
poor	1
invalid	1
said	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
exchanging	1
an	1
alarmed	1
glance	1
with	1
her	1
aunt	1
as	1
she	1
conducted	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
pierre	1
murmured	1
something	1
unintelligible	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
something	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1

he	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1

with	1
a	1
pleased	1

as	1

her	1
speech	1
about	1

anna	1
pvlovna	1
in	1
dismay	1
detained	1

with	1
the	1

he	1
is	1

yes	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
scheme	1
for	1
perpetual	1
peace	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
but	1
hardly	1
feasible	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
rejoined	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
and	1
get	1
away	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess	1
but	1
pierre	1
now	1
committed	1
a	1
reverse	1
act	1
of	1
impoliteness	1
first	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
a	1
lady	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
another	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
bent	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
feet	1
spread	1
apart	1
he	1
began	1
explaining	1
his	1
reasons	1
for	1
thinking	1
the	1
abbs	1
plan	1
chimerical	1
we	1
will	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
later	1
said	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
having	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
behave	1
she	1
resumed	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
watch	1
ready	1
to	1
help	1
at	1
any	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
conversation	1
might	1
happen	1
to	1
flag	1
as	1
the	1
foreman	1
of	1
a	1
spinning	1
mill	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
set	1
the	1
hands	1
to	1

goes	1
round	1

notices	1
here	1
a	1

that	1
has	1
stopped	1
or	1
there	1
one	1
that	1
creaks	1
or	1
makes	1
more	1
noise	1
than	1
it	1
should	1
and	1
hastens	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
machine	1
or	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
proper	1
motion	1
so	1
anna	1

moved	1
about	1
her	1
drawing	1
room	1
approaching	1
now	1
a	1
silent	1
now	1
a	1
toonoisy	1
group	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
word	1

slight	1
rearrangement	1
kept	1
the	1
conversational	1
machine	1
in	1
steady	1
proper	1
and	1
regular	1
motion	1
but	1
amid	1
these	1
cares	1
her	1
anxiety	1
about	1

was	1
evident	1
she	1
kept	1
an	1
anxious	1
watch	1
on	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
group	1
round	1

to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
was	1

there	1

again	1
when	1

passed	1
to	1
another	1

was	1
the	1
abb	1
pierre	1

been	1
educated	1

knew	1
that	1
all	1

gathered	1
there	1
and	1
like	1

did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
way	1
to	1
look	1
afraid	1
of	1
missing	1
any	1
clever	1
conversation	1
that	1
was	1

he	1
was	1
always	1
expecting	1
to	1

something	1
very	1
profound	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
morio	1
here	1
the	1
conversation	1
seemed	1
interesting	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1

something	1
extraordinary	1
when	1
she	1
took	1
her	1

upon	1
him	1
also	1
with	1
her	1
unchanging	1
smile	1

before	1
such	1
an	1
audience	1

he	1
smilingly	1
inclining	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
princess	1
rested	1
her	1
bare	1
round	1
arm	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
and	1
considered	1
a	1
reply	1
unnecessary	1
she	1
smilingly	1
waited	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
story	1
was	1
being	1
told	1
she	1
sat	1
upright	1
glancing	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
beautiful	1
round	1
arm	1
altered	1
in	1
shape	1
by	1
its	1
pressure	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
still	1
more	1
beautiful	1
bosom	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
readjusted	1
a	1
diamond	1
necklace	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
she	1
smoothed	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
whenever	1
the	1
story	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
at	1
once	1
adopted	1
just	1
the	1
expression	1
she	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
maid	1
of	1
honors	1
face	1
and	1
again	1
relapsed	1
into	1
her	1
radiant	1
smile	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
also	1
left	1
the	1
tea	1
table	1
and	1
followed	1

now	1
then	1
what	1
are	1

of	1

went	1
on	1
turning	1
to	1
prince	1
hippolyte	1

me	1
my	1
workbag	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
movement	1
as	1
the	1
princess	1
smiling	1
and	1
talking	1
merrily	1
to	1
everyone	1
at	1
once	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
gaily	1
arranged	1
herself	1
in	1
her	1
seat	1
now	1
i	1
am	1
all	1
right	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
asking	1
the	1
vicomte	1
to	1
begin	1
she	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
work	1
prince	1
hippolyte	1
having	1
brought	1
the	1
workbag	1
joined	1
the	1
circle	1
and	1
moving	1
a	1
chair	1
close	1
to	1
hers	1
seated	1
himself	1
beside	1
her	1
le	1
charmant	1
hippolyte	1
was	1
surprising	1
by	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
resemblance	1
to	1
his	1
beautiful	1
sister	1
but	1
yet	1
more	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
resemblance	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
ugly	1
his	1
features	1
were	1
like	1
his	1
sisters	1
but	1
while	1
in	1
her	1
case	1
everything	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
joyous	1
selfsatisfied	1
youthful	1
and	1
constant	1
smile	1
of	1
animation	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
wonderful	1
classic	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
figure	1
his	1
face	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
was	1
dulled	1
by	1
imbecility	1
and	1
a	1
constant	1
expression	1
of	1
sullen	1
selfconfidence	1
while	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
thin	1
and	1
weak	1
his	1
eyes	1
nose	1
and	1
mouth	1
all	1
seemed	1
puckered	1
into	1
a	1
vacant	1
wearied	1
grimace	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
always	1
fell	1
into	1
unnatural	1
positions	1
its	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
ghost	1
story	1
said	1
he	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
hastily	1
adjusting	1
his	1
lorgnette	1
as	1
if	1
without	1
this	1
instrument	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
why	1
no	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
said	1
the	1
astonished	1
narrator	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
because	1
i	1

ghost	1
stories	1
said	1
prince	1
hippolyte	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
uttered	1
them	1
he	1
spoke	1
with	1
such	1
selfconfidence	1
that	1
his	1
hearers	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
sure	1
whether	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
very	1
witty	1
or	1
very	1
stupid	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
darkgreen	1
dress	1
coat	1

of	1
the	1
color	1
of	1

as	1
he	1
called	1
it	1
shoes	1
and	1
silk	1
stockings	1
the	1
vicomte	1
told	1
his	1
tale	1
very	1
neatly	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
anecdote	1
then	1
current	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
the	1
duc	1
denghien	1
had	1
gone	1
secretly	1
to	1
paris	1
to	1
visit	1
mademoiselle	1
george	1
that	1
at	1
her	1
house	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
bonaparte	1
who	1
also	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
famous	1
actress	1
favors	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
napoleon	1
happened	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fainting	1
fits	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
subject	1
and	1
was	1
thus	1
at	1
the	1
ducs	1
mercy	1
the	1
latter	1
spared	1
him	1
and	1
this	1
magnanimity	1
bonaparte	1
subsequently	1
repaid	1
by	1
death	1
the	1
story	1
was	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
interesting	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
rivals	1
suddenly	1
recognized	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
looked	1
agitated	1
charming	1
said	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
with	1
an	1
inquiring	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
little	1

whispered	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
sticking	1
the	1
needle	1
into	1
her	1
work	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
testify	1
that	1
the	1
interest	1
and	1
fascination	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
going	1
on	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
vicomte	1
appreciated	1
this	1
silent	1
praise	1
and	1
smiling	1
gratefully	1
prepared	1
to	1
continue	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
who	1
had	1
kept	1
a	1
watchful	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
so	1
alarmed	1
her	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
too	1
loudly	1
and	1
vehemently	1
with	1
the	1
abb	1
so	1
she	1
hurried	1
to	1
the	1
rescue	1
pierre	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
abb	1
about	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
evidently	1
interested	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
mans	1
simpleminded	1
eagerness	1
was	1
explaining	1
his	1
pet	1
theory	1
both	1
were	1
talking	1
and	1
listening	1
too	1
eagerly	1
and	1
too	1
naturally	1
which	1
was	1
why	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
disapproved	1
the	1
means	1
are	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
europe	1
and	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
abb	1
was	1
saying	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
necessary	1
for	1
one	1
powerful	1
nation	1
like	1
russiabarbaric	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
beto	1
place	1
herself	1
disinterestedly	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
an	1
alliance	1
having	1
for	1
its	1
object	1
the	1
maintenance	1
of	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
of	1
europe	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
save	1
the	1
world	1

how	1
are	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
that	1
balance	1
pierre	1
was	1
beginning	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
looking	1
severely	1
at	1
pierre	1
asked	1
the	1
italian	1
how	1
he	1
stood	1
russian	1
climate	1
the	1
italians	1
face	1
instantly	1
changed	1
and	1
assumed	1
an	1
offensively	1
affected	1
sugary	1
expression	1
evidently	1
habitual	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
conversing	1
with	1
women	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
enchanted	1
by	1
the	1
brilliancy	1
of	1
the	1
wit	1
and	1
culture	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
more	1
especially	1
of	1
the	1
feminine	1
society	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
being	1
received	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1

not	1
letting	1
the	1
abb	1

pierre	1
escape	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
the	1
more	1
conveniently	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
under	1
observation	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
larger	1
circle	1
chapter	1
iv	1
just	1
then	1
another	1
visitor	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
prince	1
andrew	1
bolknski	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
husband	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
medium	1
height	1
with	1
firm	1
clearcut	1
features	1
everything	1
about	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
weary	1
bored	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
quiet	1
measured	1
step	1
offered	1
a	1
most	1
striking	1
contrast	1
to	1
his	1
quiet	1
little	1
wife	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
knew	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
but	1
had	1
found	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
tiresome	1
that	1
it	1
wearied	1
him	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
or	1
listen	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
among	1
all	1
these	1
faces	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
so	1
tedious	1
none	1
seemed	1
to	1
bore	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
pretty	1
wife	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
grimace	1
that	1
distorted	1
his	1
handsome	1
face	1
kissed	1
anna	1
pvlovnas	1
hand	1
and	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
scanned	1
the	1
whole	1
company	1
you	1
are	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
war	1
prince	1
said	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
general	1
kutzov	1
said	1
bolknski	1
speaking	1
french	1
and	1
stressing	1
the	1
last	1
syllable	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
name	1
like	1
a	1
frenchman	1
has	1
been	1

not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
deprive	1
us	1
of	1
your	1
charming	1
wife	1

said	1
his	1
wife	1
addressing	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
coquettish	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
other	1
men	1
the	1
vicomte	1
has	1
been	1
telling	1
us	1
such	1
a	1
tale	1
about	1
mademoiselle	1
george	1
and	1
buonaparte	1
prince	1
andrew	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
pierre	1
who	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
prince	1
andrew	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
watched	1
him	1
with	1
glad	1
affectionate	1
eyes	1
now	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
arm	1
before	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
prince	1
andrew	1
frowned	1
again	1
expressing	1
his	1
annoyance	1
with	1
whoever	1
was	1
touching	1
his	1
arm	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
pierres	1
beaming	1
face	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
unexpectedly	1
kind	1
and	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
there	1
now	1
so	1
you	1
too	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
world	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
pierre	1
i	1
knew	1
you	1

be	1
here	1
replied	1
pierre	1
i	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
supper	1
with	1
you	1
may	1
i	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
vicomte	1
who	1
was	1
continuing	1
his	1
story	1
no	1
impossible	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
laughing	1
and	1
pressing	1
pierres	1
hand	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
more	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
prince	1
vasli	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
men	1
rose	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
pass	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
me	1
dear	1
vicomte	1
said	1
prince	1
vasli	1
to	1
the	1
frenchman	1
holding	1
him	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
sleeve	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
way	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
rising	1
this	1
unfortunate	1
fete	1
at	1
the	1
ambassadors	1
deprives	1
me	1
of	1
a	1
pleasure	1
and	1
obliges	1
me	1
to	1
interrupt	1
you	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
to	1
leave	1
your	1
enchanting	1
party	1
said	1
he	1
turning	1
to	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
his	1
daughter	1
princess	1
hlne	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
chairs	1
lightly	1
holding	1
up	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
shone	1
still	1
more	1
radiantly	1
on	1
her	1
beautiful	1
face	1
pierre	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
rapturous	1
almost	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
him	1
very	1
lovely	1

very	1
said	1

in	1

has	1
been	1
staying	1

a	1
whole	1
month	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
society	1
nothing	1
is	1
so	1
necessary	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
as	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
clever	1
women	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
smiled	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
take	1
pierre	1
in	1
hand	1
she	1
knew	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
connection	1
of	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
aunt	1
rose	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
overtook	1
prince	1
vasli	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom	1
all	1
the	1
affectation	1
of	1
interest	1
she	1
had	1
assumed	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
kindly	1
and	1
tearworn	1
face	1
and	1
it	1
now	1
expressed	1
only	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fear	1
how	1
about	1
my	1
son	1
bors	1
prince	1
said	1
she	1
hurrying	1
after	1
him	1
into	1
the	1

may	1
take	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
boy	1
although	1
prince	1
vasli	1
listened	1
reluctantly	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
politely	1
to	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady	1
even	1
betraying	1
some	1
impatience	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
ingratiating	1
and	1
appealing	1
smile	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
go	1
away	1
what	1
would	1
it	1
cost	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
emperor	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
guards	1
at	1
once	1

she	1
believe	1
me	1
princess	1

it	1
is	1
difficult	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
emperor	1
i	1
should	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
appeal	1
to	1
rumyntsev	1
through	1
prince	1
goltsyn	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
way	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady	1
was	1
a	1
princess	1
drubetskya	1
belonging	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
families	1
in	1
russia	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
poor	1
and	1
having	1
long	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
society	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
former	1
influential	1
connections	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
petersburg	1
to	1
procure	1
an	1
appointment	1
in	1
the	1
guards	1
for	1
her	1
only	1
son	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
solely	1
to	1
meet	1
prince	1
vasli	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
obtained	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
anna	1

and	1
had	1
sat	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
vicomtes	1
story	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
words	1
frightened	1
her	1
an	1
embittered	1
look	1
clouded	1
her	1
once	1
handsome	1
face	1
but	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
then	1
she	1
smiled	1
again	1
and	1
clutched	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
arm	1
more	1
tightly	1
listen	1
to	1
me	1
prince	1
said	1
she	1
i	1

never	1
yet	1
asked	1
you	1
for	1
anything	1
and	1
i	1
never	1
will	1
again	1
nor	1
have	1
i	1
ever	1
reminded	1
you	1
of	1
my	1
fathers	1
friendship	1
for	1
you	1
but	1
now	1
i	1
entreat	1
you	1
for	1

this	1
for	1
my	1

you	1

added	1
hurriedly	1
no	1

angry	1
but	1
promise	1
i	1
have	1
asked	1
goltsyn	1
and	1
he	1

princess	1
hlne	1
turning	1
her	1
beautiful	1
head	1
and	1
looking	1
over	1

classically	1

a	1

which	1
has	1
to	1

if	1

prince	1
vasli	1
knew	1
this	1
and	1
having	1
once	1
realized	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
asked	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
begged	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
himself	1
he	1
became	1
chary	1
of	1
using	1
his	1
influence	1
but	1
in	1
princess	1
drubetskyas	1
case	1
he	1
felt	1
after	1
her	1
second	1
appeal	1
something	1
like	1
qualms	1
of	1
conscience	1
she	1
had	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
quite	1
true	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
indebted	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
steps	1
in	1
his	1
career	1
moreover	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
her	1
manners	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
womenmostly	1
motherswho	1
having	1
once	1
made	1
up	1
their	1
minds	1
will	1
not	1
rest	1
until	1
they	1
have	1
gained	1
their	1
end	1
and	1
are	1
prepared	1
if	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
on	1

and	1

even	1

he	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
familiarity	1
and	1

is	1
almost	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1

mikhylovna	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
a	1
coquettish	1
girl	1
which	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
probably	1
came	1
naturally	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
was	1
now	1
very	1
illsuited	1
to	1
her	1
careworn	1
face	1
apparently	1
she	1
had	1
forgotten	1
her	1
age	1
and	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
employed	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
feminine	1
arts	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
gone	1
her	1
face	1
resumed	1
its	1
former	1
cold	1
artificial	1
expression	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
group	1
where	1
the	1
vicomte	1
was	1
still	1
talking	1
and	1
again	1
pretended	1
to	1
listen	1
while	1
waiting	1
till	1
it	1
would	1
be	1

to	1

he	1
was	1
very	1
fine	1

the	1

this	1
man	1

is	1
a	1
menace	1
to	1
everything	1
the	1
sovereigns	1
i	1
do	1

done	1
for	1

for	1
the	1
queen	1

for	1
madame	1
elizabeth	1
nothing	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
believe	1

they	1
are	1
reaping	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
their	1
betrayal	1
of	1
the	1
bourbon	1
cause	1
the	1
sovereigns	1
why	1
they	1
are	1
sending	1
ambassadors	1
to	1
compliment	1
the	1
usurper	1
and	1
sighing	1
disdainfully	1
he	1
again	1
changed	1
his	1
position	1
prince	1
hippolyte	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
vicomte	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
through	1
his	1
lorgnette	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
completely	1
round	1
toward	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
and	1
having	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
needle	1
began	1
tracing	1
the	1
cond	1
coat	1
of	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
explained	1
this	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
gravity	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1

said	1
he	1
the	1
princess	1
listened	1
smiling	1
if	1
buonaparte	1
remains	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
france	1
a	1
year	1
longer	1
the	1
vicomte	1
continued	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
better	1
acquainted	1
than	1
anyone	1
else	1
does	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
others	1
but	1
follows	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts	1
things	1
will	1
have	1
gone	1
too	1
far	1
by	1
intrigues	1
violence	1
exile	1
and	1
executions	1
french	1
societyi	1
mean	1
good	1
french	1
societywill	1
have	1
been	1
forever	1
destroyed	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
hands	1
pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
remark	1
for	1
the	1
conversation	1
interested	1
him	1
but	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
who	1
had	1
him	1
under	1
observation	1
interrupted	1
the	1
emperor	1
alexander	1
said	1
she	1
with	1
the	1
melancholy	1
which	1
always	1
accompanied	1
any	1
reference	1
of	1
hers	1
to	1
the	1
imperial	1
family	1
has	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
french	1
people	1
themselves	1
to	1
choose	1
their	1
own	1
form	1
of	1
government	1
and	1
i	1
believe	1
that	1
once	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
usurper	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
will	1
certainly	1
throw	1
itself	1
into	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
its	1
rightful	1
king	1
she	1
concluded	1
trying	1
to	1
be	1
amiable	1
to	1
the	1
royalist	1
emigrant	1
that	1
is	1
doubtful	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
monsieur	1
le	1
vicomte	1
quite	1
rightly	1
supposes	1
that	1
matters	1
have	1
already	1
gone	1
too	1
far	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
regime	1
from	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
said	1
pierre	1
blushing	1
and	1
breaking	1
into	1
the	1
conversation	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
aristocracy	1
has	1
already	1
gone	1
over	1
to	1
bonapartes	1
side	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
buonapartists	1
who	1
say	1
that	1
replied	1
the	1
vicomte	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
pierre	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
time	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
real	1
state	1
of	1
french	1
public	1
opinion	1
bonaparte	1
has	1
said	1
so	1
remarked	1
prince	1
andrew	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
vicomte	1
and	1
was	1
aiming	1
his	1
remarks	1
at	1
him	1
though	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
i	1
showed	1
them	1
the	1
path	1
to	1
glory	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
it	1
prince	1
andrew	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
silence	1
again	1
quoting	1
napoleons	1
words	1
i	1
opened	1
my	1
antechambers	1
and	1
they	1
crowded	1
in	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
far	1
he	1
was	1
justified	1
in	1
saying	1
so	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
replied	1
the	1
vicomte	1
after	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
duc	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
partial	1
ceased	1
to	1
regard	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
hero	1
if	1
to	1
some	1
people	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
turning	1
to	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
he	1
ever	1
was	1
a	1
hero	1
after	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
duc	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
martyr	1
more	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
one	1
hero	1
less	1
on	1
earth	1
before	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
smile	1
their	1
appreciation	1
of	1
the	1
vicomtes	1
epigram	1
pierre	1
again	1
broke	1
into	1
the	1
conversation	1
and	1
though	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
felt	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
something	1
inappropriate	1
she	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
stop	1
him	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
duc	1
denghien	1
declared	1
monsieur	1
pierre	1
was	1
a	1
political	1
necessity	1
and	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
napoleon	1
showed	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul	1
by	1
not	1
fearing	1
to	1
take	1
on	1
himself	1
the	1
whole	1
responsibility	1
of	1
that	1
deed	1
dieu	1
mon	1
dieu	1
muttered	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
in	1
a	1
terrified	1
whisper	1
what	1
monsieur	1
pierre	1
do	1
you	1
consider	1
that	1
assassination	1
shows	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
smiling	1
and	1
drawing	1
her	1
work	1
nearer	1
to	1
her	1
oh	1
oh	1
exclaimed	1
several	1
voices	1
capital	1
said	1
prince	1
hippolyte	1
in	1
english	1
and	1
began	1
slapping	1
his	1
knee	1
with	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
vicomte	1
merely	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
pierre	1
looked	1
solemnly	1
at	1
his	1
audience	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
and	1
continued	1
i	1
say	1
so	1
he	1
continued	1
desperately	1
because	1
the	1
bourbons	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
revolution	1
leaving	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
anarchy	1
and	1
napoleon	1
alone	1
understood	1
the	1
revolution	1
and	1
quelled	1
it	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
good	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stop	1
short	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
one	1
mans	1
life	1
wont	1
you	1
come	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
table	1
suggested	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
but	1
pierre	1
continued	1
his	1
speech	1
without	1
heeding	1
her	1
no	1
cried	1
he	1
becoming	1
more	1

when	1

that	1

said	1
the	1

to	1
ask	1
how	1
monsieur	1
explains	1
the	1
th	1
brumaire	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
an	1
imposture	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
swindle	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners	1
he	1
killed	1
in	1
africa	1
that	1
was	1
horrible	1

to	1

looked	1

when	1
he	1
smiled	1
his	1

anothera	1

the	1
vicomte	1
who	1
was	1
meeting	1
him	1
for	1
the	1

was	1
not	1
so	1
terrible	1
as	1

how	1
do	1
you	1

him	1
to	1

said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
besides	1
in	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
a	1

has	1
to	1

a	1
private	1
person	1
as	1
a	1

as	1
an	1

at	1
the	1

one	1
must	1

continued	1
prince	1
andrew	1
that	1
napoleon	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
great	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
arcola	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hospital	1
at	1
jaffa	1
where	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
plaguestricken	1
but	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
acts	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
justify	1
prince	1
andrew	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
wished	1
to	1
tone	1
down	1
the	1
awkwardness	1
of	1
pierres	1
remarks	1
rose	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
suddenly	1
prince	1
hippolyte	1
started	1
up	1
making	1
signs	1
to	1
everyone	1
to	1
attend	1
and	1
asking	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
seated	1

vicomtei	1

tell	1
it	1
in	1
russian	1
or	1
the	1
point	1
will	1
be	1
lost	1
and	1
prince	1
hippolyte	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
story	1
in	1
such	1
russian	1
as	1
a	1
frenchman	1
would	1
speak	1
after	1
spending	1
about	1
a	1
year	1
in	1
russia	1
everyone	1
waited	1
so	1
emphatically	1
and	1
eagerly	1
did	1
he	1
demand	1
their	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
story	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
moscow	1
a	1
lady	1
une	1
dame	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
stingy	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
two	1
footmen	1
behind	1
her	1
carriage	1
and	1
very	1
big	1
ones	1
that	1
was	1
her	1
taste	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
ladys	1
maid	1
also	1
big	1
she	1
said	1
here	1
prince	1
hippolyte	1
paused	1
evidently	1
collecting	1
his	1
ideas	1
with	1
difficulty	1
she	1
said	1
oh	1

she	1
said	1

to	1
the	1

up	1
behind	1

come	1
with	1
me	1
while	1
i	1
make	1
some	1
calls	1
here	1
prince	1
hippolyte	1
spluttered	1
and	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing	1
long	1
before	1
his	1
audience	1
which	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
unfavorable	1
to	1
the	1
narrator	1
several	1
persons	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady	1

lost	1
her	1

and	1
her	1
long	1

came	1
down	1
here	1
he	1
could	1
contain	1
himself	1
no	1
longer	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
between	1
gasps	1
of	1
laughter	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
knew	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
anecdote	1
ended	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
unintelligible	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
it	1
or	1
why	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
in	1
russian	1
still	1
anna	1

up	1
into	1
insignificant	1
small	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
last	1

next	1

about	1

not	1

how	1
to	1

something	1
particularly	1
agreeable	1

away	1

this	1
he	1
was	1
absentminded	1

held	1
it	1
pulling	1
at	1

asked	1
him	1
to	1
restore	1
it	1
all	1
his	1
absentmindedness	1
and	1
inability	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
room	1
and	1
converse	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
however	1
redeemed	1
by	1
his	1
kindly	1
simple	1
and	1
modest	1
expression	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
turned	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
christian	1
mildness	1
that	1
expressed	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
his	1
indiscretion	1
nodded	1
and	1
said	1
i	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
you	1

i	1
also	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
change	1
your	1
opinions	1
my	1

monsieur	1
pierre	1
when	1
she	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
and	1
only	1
bowed	1
but	1
again	1
everybody	1
saw	1
his	1
smile	1
which	1
said	1
nothing	1
unless	1
perhaps	1
opinions	1
are	1
opinions	1

you	1
see	1
what	1

out	1
into	1

turning	1
his	1
shoulders	1
to	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
was	1
helping	1
him	1
on	1
with	1
his	1

listened	1
indifferently	1
to	1
his	1

with	1
prince	1

who	1
had	1
also	1
come	1
into	1
the	1

hippolyte	1
stood	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
pretty	1
pregnant	1

at	1

through	1

a	1

she	1
left	1
the	1

hippolyte	1
approached	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
and	1
bending	1
his	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
began	1
to	1
whisper	1
something	1
two	1
footmen	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
stood	1
holding	1
a	1
shawl	1
and	1
a	1
cloak	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
finish	1
they	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
french	1
sentences	1
which	1
to	1
them	1
were	1
meaningless	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
understanding	1
but	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
the	1
princess	1
as	1
usual	1
spoke	1
smilingly	1
and	1
listened	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1

the	1
princess	1
drawing	1
up	1
her	1
downy	1
little	1
lip	1
all	1
the	1
pretty	1
women	1

said	1
prince	1
hippolyte	1
smiling	1
joyfully	1
and	1
snatching	1
the	1
shawl	1
from	1
the	1
footman	1
whom	1
he	1
even	1
pushed	1
aside	1
he	1
began	1
wrapping	1
it	1
round	1
the	1
princess	1
either	1
from	1
awkwardness	1
or	1
intentionally	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
which	1
after	1
the	1
shawl	1
had	1
been	1
adjusted	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
arm	1
around	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
as	1
though	1
embracing	1
her	1
still	1

gracefully	1
moved	1
away	1

were	1
closed	1

he	1
asked	1
his	1

looking	1
past	1

prince	1
hippolyte	1
hurriedly	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
cloak	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
latest	1
fashion	1
reached	1
to	1
his	1
very	1
heels	1
and	1
stumbling	1
in	1
it	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1

blocking	1
his	1
path	1
i	1

and	1
affectionately	1

prince	1
hippolyte	1
laughed	1
spasmodically	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
vicomte	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1

the	1

having	1
seated	1
himself	1
beside	1
hippolyte	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
your	1
little	1
princess	1
is	1
very	1
nice	1
very	1
nice	1
indeed	1

he	1
kissed	1
the	1

of	1
his	1
fingers	1
hippolyte	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing	1
do	1
you	1

you	1
are	1
a	1
terrible	1
chap	1
for	1
all	1
your	1
innocent	1
airs	1

the	1
vicomte	1
i	1
pity	1
the	1

little	1
officer	1
who	1

airs	1
of	1
a	1
monarch	1
hippolyte	1
spluttered	1
again	1
and	1
amid	1
his	1
laughter	1
said	1
and	1
you	1
were	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
russian	1
ladies	1
are	1
not	1

the	1

pierre	1
reaching	1
the	1
house	1
first	1
went	1
into	1
prince	1
andrews	1
study	1
like	1
one	1
quite	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
from	1
habit	1
immediately	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
took	1
from	1
the	1
shelf	1
the	1
first	1
book	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
hand	1
it	1
was	1
caesars	1
commentaries	1
and	1
resting	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
began	1
reading	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
to	1
mlle	1
schrer	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
ill	1

said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
study	1
rubbing	1
his	1
small	1
white	1
hands	1
pierre	1
turned	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
making	1
the	1
sofa	1
creak	1
he	1
lifted	1
his	1
eager	1
face	1
to	1
prince	1
andrew	1
smiled	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1
hand	1
that	1
abb	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
but	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
light	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
perpetual	1
peace	1
is	1
possible	1
buti	1
do	1

how	1
to	1
express	1
it	1
not	1
by	1
a	1
balance	1
of	1
political	1
power	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
prince	1
andrew	1
was	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
such	1
abstract	1
conversation	1
one	1
cant	1
everywhere	1
say	1
all	1
one	1
thinks	1
mon	1

guardsman	1
or	1
a	1
diplomatist	1
asked	1
prince	1
andrew	1
after	1
a	1
momentary	1
silence	1
pierre	1
sat	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
tucked	1
under	1
him	1
really	1
i	1
dont	1
yet	1
know	1
i	1
dont	1
like	1
either	1
the	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
decide	1
on	1
something	1
your	1
father	1
expects	1
it	1
pierre	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
ten	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
abroad	1
with	1
an	1
abb	1
as	1
tutor	1
and	1
had	1
remained	1
away	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
twenty	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
moscow	1
his	1
father	1
dismissed	1
the	1
abb	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
now	1
go	1
to	1
petersburg	1
look	1
round	1
and	1
choose	1
your	1
profession	1
i	1
will	1
agree	1
to	1
anything	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
prince	1
vasli	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
money	1
write	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
help	1
you	1
in	1
everything	1
pierre	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
choosing	1
a	1
career	1
for	1
three	1
months	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
decided	1
on	1
anything	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
this	1
choice	1
that	1
prince	1
andrew	1
was	1
speaking	1
pierre	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead	1
but	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
freemason	1
said	1
he	1
referring	1
to	1
the	1
abb	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
that	1
evening	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
nonsense	1
prince	1
andrew	1
again	1
interrupted	1
him	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
business	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
horse	1
guards	1
no	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
war	1
now	1
against	1
napoleon	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
war	1
for	1
freedom	1
i	1
could	1
understand	1
it	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
army	1
but	1
to	1
help	1
england	1
and	1
austria	1
against	1
the	1
greatest	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
prince	1
andrew	1
only	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
at	1
pierres	1
childish	1
words	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
finds	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
such	1
nonsense	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
in	1
fact	1
have	1
been	1
difficult	1
to	1
give	1
any	1
other	1
answer	1
than	1
the	1
one	1
prince	1
andrew	1
gave	1
to	1
this	1
nave	1
question	1
if	1
no	1
one	1
fought	1
except	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
conviction	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
wars	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
splendid	1
said	1
pierre	1
prince	1
andrew	1
smiled	1
ironically	1
very	1
likely	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
splendid	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
never	1
come	1
about	1
well	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war	1
asked	1
pierre	1
what	1
for	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
i	1
must	1
besides	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
he	1
paused	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
because	1
the	1
life	1
i	1
am	1
leading	1
here	1
does	1
not	1
suit	1

the	1

of	1
a	1
womans	1
dress	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
prince	1
andrew	1
shook	1
himself	1
as	1
if	1
waking	1
up	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
the	1
look	1
it	1
had	1
had	1

from	1

the	1
princess	1
came	1
in	1
she	1
had	1
changed	1
her	1
gown	1
for	1
a	1
house	1
dress	1
as	1
fresh	1
and	1
elegant	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
prince	1
andrew	1
rose	1
and	1
politely	1
placed	1
a	1
chair	1
for	1
her	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
she	1
began	1
as	1
usual	1
in	1
french	1
settling	1
down	1
briskly	1
and	1
fussily	1
in	1
the	1
easy	1
chair	1
how	1

it	1
annette	1
never	1
got	1
married	1
how	1
stupid	1
you	1

all	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
married	1
her	1
excuse	1
me	1
for	1
saying	1
so	1
but	1

have	1
no	1
sense	1
about	1
women	1
what	1
an	1
argumentative	1
fellow	1
you	1
are	1
monsieur	1
pierre	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
still	1
arguing	1
with	1
your	1
husband	1
i	1
cant	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
war	1
replied	1
pierre	1
addressing	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
embarrassment	1
so	1
commonly	1
shown	1
by	1
young	1
men	1
in	1
their	1
intercourse	1
with	1
young	1
women	1
the	1
princess	1
started	1
evidently	1
pierres	1
words	1
touched	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
ah	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
i	1
tell	1
him	1
said	1
she	1
i	1
dont	1
understand	1
it	1
i	1
dont	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
understand	1
why	1
men	1
cant	1
live	1
without	1
wars	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
women	1
dont	1
want	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
dont	1
need	1
it	1
now	1
you	1
shall	1
judge	1
between	1
us	1
i	1
always	1
tell	1
him	1
here	1
he	1
is	1
uncles	1
aidedecamp	1
a	1
most	1
brilliant	1
position	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
so	1
much	1
appreciated	1
by	1
everyone	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
at	1
the	1
aprksins	1
i	1
heard	1
a	1
lady	1
asking	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
famous	1
prince	1
andrew	1
i	1
did	1
indeed	1
she	1
laughed	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
received	1
everywhere	1
he	1
might	1
easily	1
become	1
aidedecamp	1
to	1
the	1
emperor	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
emperor	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
most	1
graciously	1
annette	1
and	1
i	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
arrange	1
it	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
noticing	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
conversation	1
gave	1
no	1
reply	1
when	1
are	1
you	1
starting	1
he	1
asked	1
oh	1
dont	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
going	1
dont	1
i	1
wont	1
hear	1
it	1
spoken	1
of	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
petulantly	1
playful	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
hippolyte	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
plainly	1
illsuited	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
circle	1
of	1
which	1
pierre	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
member	1
today	1
when	1
i	1
remembered	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
delightful	1
associations	1
must	1
be	1
broken	1
off	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
know	1
andr	1
she	1
looked	1
significantly	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
im	1
afraid	1
im	1
afraid	1
she	1
whispered	1
and	1
a	1
shudder	1
ran	1
down	1
her	1
back	1
her	1
husband	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
surprised	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
someone	1
besides	1
pierre	1
and	1
himself	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
addressed	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
frigid	1
politeness	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
are	1
afraid	1
of	1
lise	1
i	1
dont	1
understand	1
said	1
he	1
there	1
what	1
egotists	1
men	1
all	1
are	1
all	1
all	1
egotists	1
just	1
for	1
a	1
whim	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
goodness	1
only	1
knows	1
why	1
he	1
leaves	1
me	1
and	1
locks	1
me	1
up	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
sister	1
remember	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
gently	1
alone	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
without	1
my	1
friends	1
and	1
he	1
expects	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
her	1
tone	1
was	1
now	1
querulous	1
and	1
her	1
lip	1
drawn	1
up	1
giving	1
her	1
not	1
a	1
joyful	1
but	1
an	1
animal	1
squirrellike	1
expression	1
she	1
paused	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
indecorous	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
pregnancy	1
before	1
pierre	1
though	1
the	1
gist	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
lay	1
in	1
that	1
i	1
still	1
cant	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
afraid	1
of	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
slowly	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
his	1
wife	1
the	1
princess	1
blushed	1
and	1
raised	1
her	1
arms	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
despair	1
no	1
andrew	1
i	1
must	1
say	1
you	1
have	1
changed	1
oh	1
how	1
you	1
have	1
your	1
doctor	1
tells	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
earlier	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
the	1
princess	1
said	1
nothing	1
but	1
suddenly	1
her	1
short	1
downy	1
lip	1
quivered	1
prince	1
andrew	1
rose	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
pierre	1
looked	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
with	1
nave	1
surprise	1
now	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
moved	1
as	1
if	1
about	1
to	1
rise	1
too	1
but	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
why	1
should	1
i	1
mind	1
monsieur	1
pierre	1
being	1
here	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
suddenly	1
her	1
pretty	1
face	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
distorted	1
by	1
a	1
tearful	1
grimace	1
i	1
have	1
long	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
andrew	1
why	1
you	1
have	1
changed	1
so	1
to	1
me	1
what	1
have	1
i	1
done	1
to	1
you	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
pity	1
for	1
me	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
lise	1
was	1
all	1
prince	1
andrew	1
said	1
but	1
that	1
one	1
word	1
expressed	1
an	1
entreaty	1
a	1
threat	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
conviction	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
herself	1
regret	1
her	1
words	1
but	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
hurriedly	1
you	1
treat	1
me	1
like	1
an	1
invalid	1
or	1
a	1
child	1
i	1
see	1
it	1
all	1
did	1
you	1
behave	1
like	1
that	1
six	1
months	1
ago	1
lise	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
desist	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
still	1
more	1
emphatically	1
pierre	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
agitated	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
rose	1
and	1
approached	1
the	1
princess	1
he	1
seemed	1
unable	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
himself	1
calm	1
yourself	1
princess	1
it	1
seems	1
so	1
to	1
you	1
because	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
i	1
myself	1
have	1
experienced	1
and	1
so	1
because	1
no	1
excuse	1
me	1
an	1
outsider	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
here	1
no	1
dont	1
distress	1
yourself	1
goodby	1
prince	1
andrew	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
no	1

pierre	1
the	1
princess	1
is	1
too	1
kind	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
deprive	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
spending	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
you	1
no	1
he	1
thinks	1
only	1
of	1
himself	1
muttered	1
the	1
princess	1
without	1
restraining	1
her	1
angry	1
tears	1
lise	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
dryly	1
raising	1

the	1

expression	1
of	1

at	1

his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1

and	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
nervous	1
agitation	1
such	1
as	1
pierre	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
seen	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
began	1
to	1
talkas	1
one	1
who	1

long	1
had	1
something	1
on	1

out	1
never	1
never	1

you	1
can	1
say	1
to	1
yourself	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
you	1
are	1
capable	1
of	1
and	1
until	1
you	1
have	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
your	1
choice	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
plainly	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
or	1
else	1
you	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
cruel	1
and	1
irrevocable	1
mistake	1
marry	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
old	1
and	1
good	1
for	1
nothingor	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
noble	1
in	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
lost	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
wasted	1
on	1
trifles	1
yes	1
yes	1
yes	1
dont	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
such	1
surprise	1
if	1
you	1
marry	1
expecting	1
anything	1
from	1
yourself	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
you	1
will	1
feel	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
that	1
for	1
you	1
all	1
is	1
ended	1
all	1
is	1
closed	1
except	1
the	1

where	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
ranged	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
with	1
a	1
court	1
lackey	1
and	1
an	1
idiot	1
but	1
whats	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
arm	1
pierre	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
spectacles	1
which	1
made	1
his	1
face	1
seem	1
different	1
and	1
the	1
goodnatured	1
expression	1
still	1
more	1
apparent	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
in	1
amazement	1
my	1
wife	1
continued	1
prince	1
andrew	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
woman	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
women	1
with	1
whom	1
a	1
mans	1
honor	1
is	1
safe	1
but	1
o	1
god	1
what	1
would	1
i	1
not	1
give	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
unmarried	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
only	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
i	1
mention	1
this	1
because	1
i	1
like	1
you	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
prince	1
andrew	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
ever	1
like	1
that	1
bolknski	1
who	1
had	1
lolled	1
in	1
anna	1
pvlovnas	1
easy	1
chairs	1
and	1
with	1
halfclosed	1
eyes	1
had	1
uttered	1
french	1
phrases	1
between	1
his	1
teeth	1
every	1
muscle	1
of	1
his	1
thin	1
face	1
was	1
now	1
quivering	1
with	1
nervous	1
excitement	1
his	1
eyes	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
life	1
had	1
seemed	1
extinguished	1
now	1
flashed	1
with	1
brilliant	1
light	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
lifeless	1
he	1
seemed	1
at	1
ordinary	1
times	1
the	1
more	1
impassioned	1
he	1
became	1
in	1
these	1
moments	1
of	1
almost	1
morbid	1
irritation	1
you	1
dont	1
understand	1
why	1
i	1
say	1
this	1
he	1
continued	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
life	1
you	1
talk	1
of	1
bonaparte	1
and	1
his	1
career	1
said	1
he	1
though	1
pierre	1
had	1
not	1
mentioned	1
bonaparte	1
but	1
bonaparte	1
when	1
he	1
worked	1
went	1
step	1
by	1
step	1
toward	1
his	1
goal	1
he	1
was	1
free	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
aim	1
to	1
consider	1
and	1
he	1
reached	1
it	1
but	1
tie	1
yourself	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
chained	1
convict	1
you	1
lose	1
all	1
freedom	1
and	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
of	1
hope	1
and	1
strength	1
merely	1
weighs	1
you	1
down	1
and	1
torments	1

with	1
regret	1
drawing	1
rooms	1
gossip	1
balls	1
vanity	1
and	1
trivialitythese	1
are	1
the	1
enchanted	1
circle	1
i	1
cannot	1
escape	1
from	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war	1
the	1
greatest	1
war	1
there	1

i	1

i	1

very	1
amiable	1
and	1

a	1

continued	1
prince	1
andrew	1
and	1
at	1
anna	1
pvlovnas	1
they	1
listen	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
that	1
stupid	1
set	1
without	1
whom	1
my	1
wife	1
cannot	1
exist	1
and	1
those	1
women	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
what	1
those	1
society	1
women	1
are	1
and	1
women	1

my	1

them	1
in	1
their	1
true	1
colors	1
when	1
you	1
meet	1
them	1
in	1

theres	1

my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
dont	1
marry	1
concluded	1
prince	1
andrew	1
it	1
seems	1
funny	1
to	1
me	1
said	1
pierre	1
that	1
you	1
you	1
should	1
consider	1
yourself	1
incapable	1
and	1
your	1
life	1
a	1
spoiled	1
life	1
you	1
have	1
everything	1
before	1
you	1
everything	1
and	1
you	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
his	1
sentence	1
but	1
his	1
tone	1
showed	1
how	1
highly	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
he	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
talk	1
like	1
that	1
thought	1
pierre	1
he	1
considered	1
his	1
friend	1
a	1
model	1
of	1
perfection	1
because	1
prince	1
andrew	1
possessed	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
just	1
the	1
very	1
qualities	1
pierre	1
lacked	1
and	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
best	1
described	1
as	1
strength	1
of	1
will	1
pierre	1
was	1
always	1
astonished	1
at	1
prince	1
andrews	1
calm	1
manner	1
of	1
treating	1
everybody	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
memory	1
his	1
extensive	1
reading	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
everything	1
knew	1
everything	1
and	1
had	1
an	1
opinion	1
about	1
everything	1
but	1
above	1
all	1
at	1
his	1
capacity	1
for	1
work	1
and	1
study	1
and	1
if	1
pierre	1
was	1
often	1
struck	1
by	1
andrews	1
lack	1
of	1
capacity	1
for	1
philosophical	1
meditation	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
particularly	1
addicted	1
he	1
regarded	1
even	1
this	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
defect	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
strength	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
most	1
friendly	1
and	1
simplest	1
relations	1
of	1
life	1
praise	1
and	1
commendation	1
are	1
essential	1
just	1
as	1
grease	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
wheels	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
run	1
smoothly	1
my	1
part	1
is	1
played	1
out	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
whats	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
talking	1
about	1
me	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
about	1
you	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
silence	1
smiling	1
at	1
his	1
reassuring	1
thoughts	1
that	1
smile	1
was	1
immediately	1
reflected	1
on	1
pierres	1
face	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
me	1
said	1
pierre	1
his	1
face	1
relaxing	1
into	1
a	1
careless	1
merry	1
smile	1
what	1

an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
he	1
suddenly	1
blushed	1
crimson	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
to	1
say	1
this	1
without	1
a	1
name	1
and	1
without	1
means	1
and	1
it	1
really	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
what	1
it	1
really	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
i	1
am	1
free	1
and	1

if	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
happy	1
thought	1
seriously	1
i	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1

asked	1
me	1
for	1
tonight	1
but	1
i	1
wont	1
go	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
word	1

chapter	1
ix	1
it	1
was	1
past	1
one	1
oclock	1
when	1
pierre	1
left	1
his	1
friend	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
cloudless	1
northern	1
summer	1
night	1
pierre	1
took	1
an	1
open	1
cab	1
intending	1
to	1
drive	1
straight	1
home	1
but	1
the	1
nearer	1
he	1
drew	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
sleep	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
night	1
it	1
was	1
light	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
deserted	1
street	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
more	1
like	1
morning	1
or	1
evening	1
than	1
night	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
pierre	1
remembered	1
that	1
anatole	1
kurgin	1
was	1
expecting	1
the	1
usual	1
set	1
for	1
cards	1
that	1
evening	1
after	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
generally	1
a	1
drinking	1
bout	1
finishing	1
with	1
visits	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
pierre	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
kurgins	1
thought	1
he	1
but	1
he	1
immediately	1
recalled	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
prince	1
andrew	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
there	1
then	1
as	1
happens	1
to	1
people	1
of	1
weak	1
character	1
he	1
desired	1
so	1
passionately	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
enjoy	1
that	1
dissipation	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
accustomed	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
the	1
thought	1
immediately	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
prince	1
andrew	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
account	1
because	1
before	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
promised	1
prince	1
anatole	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
gathering	1
besides	1
thought	1
he	1
all	1
such	1
words	1
of	1
honor	1
are	1
conventional	1
things	1
with	1
no	1
definite	1
meaning	1
especially	1
if	1
one	1
considers	1
that	1
by	1
tomorrow	1
one	1
may	1
be	1
dead	1
or	1
something	1
so	1
extraordinary	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
honor	1
and	1
dishonor	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
pierre	1
often	1
indulged	1
in	1
reflections	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
nullifying	1
all	1
his	1
decisions	1
and	1
intentions	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
kurgins	1
reaching	1
the	1
large	1
house	1
near	1
the	1
horse	1
guards	1
barracks	1
in	1
which	1
anatole	1
lived	1
pierre	1
entered	1
the	1
lighted	1
porch	1
ascended	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom	1
empty	1
bottles	1
cloaks	1
and	1
overshoes	1
were	1
lying	1
about	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
alcohol	1
and	1
sounds	1
of	1
voices	1
and	1
shouting	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
cards	1
and	1
supper	1
were	1
over	1
but	1
the	1
visitors	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
dispersed	1
pierre	1

that	1
his	1

the	1
most	1

feature	1
of	1
his	1

was	1
clearly	1
seen	1
the	1

the	1

this	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
resolute	1
insolent	1
intelligence	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
which	1
made	1
it	1

dlokhov	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
small	1

spent	1
tens	1

thousands	1
of	1

dlokhov	1
lived	1
with	1
him	1

had	1
placed	1

a	1
footing	1
that	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
them	1

respected	1
him	1
more	1

intimidated	1
by	1
the	1
directions	1

shouts	1
of	1
the	1

around	1

shut	1
up	1

away	1
from	1

the	1
lad	1
jumped	1
awkwardly	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
tripping	1
over	1
his	1
spurs	1
placing	1
the	1
bottle	1
on	1
the	1

where	1
he	1
could	1

easily	1
dlokhov	1
climbed	1
carefully	1
and	1
slowly	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
lowered	1
his	1
legs	1
pressing	1
against	1
both	1

silent	1
one	1
man	1
older	1
than	1
the	1

suddenly	1
pushed	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
and	1
angry	1
look	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
seize	1
hold	1

dlokhov	1
turned	1
round	1

again	1
holding	1
on	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
arranged	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
seat	1
if	1
anyone	1
comes	1
meddling	1
again	1
said	1
he	1
emitting	1
the	1
words	1
separately	1
through	1
his	1
thin	1
compressed	1
lips	1
i	1
will	1
throw	1
him	1
down	1
there	1
now	1
then	1
saying	1
this	1
he	1
again	1
turned	1
round	1
dropped	1
his	1
hands	1
took	1
the	1
bottle	1
and	1
lifted	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
free	1
hand	1
to	1
balance	1
himself	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
footmen	1
who	1
had	1
stooped	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
some	1
broken	1
glass	1
remained	1
in	1
that	1
position	1
without	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
from	1
dlokhovs	1
back	1
anatole	1
stood	1
erect	1
with	1
staring	1
eyes	1
the	1
englishman	1
looked	1
on	1
sideways	1
pursing	1
up	1
his	1
lips	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
wished	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
affair	1
ran	1
to	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
pierre	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
which	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
forgot	1
to	1
fade	1
though	1
his	1
features	1
now	1
expressed	1
horror	1
and	1
fear	1
all	1
were	1
still	1
pierre	1
took	1
his	1
hands	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
dlokhov	1
still	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
only	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
thrown	1
further	1
back	1
till	1
his	1
curly	1
hair	1
touched	1
his	1
shirt	1
collar	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
holding	1
the	1
bottle	1
was	1
lifted	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
and	1
trembled	1
with	1
the	1
effort	1
the	1
bottle	1
was	1
emptying	1
perceptibly	1
and	1
rising	1
still	1
higher	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
tilting	1
yet	1
further	1
back	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
so	1
long	1
thought	1
pierre	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
had	1
elapsed	1
suddenly	1
dlokhov	1
made	1
a	1
backward	1
movement	1
with	1
his	1
spine	1
and	1
his	1
arm	1
trembled	1
nervously	1
this	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
cause	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
to	1
slip	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
sloping	1
ledge	1
as	1
he	1
began	1
slipping	1
down	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
arm	1
wavered	1
still	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
strain	1
one	1
hand	1
moved	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
clutch	1
the	1
window	1
sill	1
but	1
refrained	1
from	1
touching	1
it	1
pierre	1
again	1
covered	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
open	1
them	1
again	1
suddenly	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
a	1
stir	1
all	1
around	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
dlokhov	1
was	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
window	1

with	1
a	1
pale	1
but	1
radiant	1
face	1
its	1
empty	1
he	1
threw	1
the	1
bottle	1
to	1
the	1
englishman	1
who	1
caught	1
it	1
neatly	1
dlokhov	1
jumped	1
down	1
he	1
smelt	1
strongly	1
of	1

well	1
done	1
fine	1

from	1

the	1
englishman	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
purse	1
and	1
began	1
counting	1
out	1
the	1
money	1
dlokhov	1
stood	1
frowning	1

did	1
not	1
speak	1

even	1

again	1

in	1
his	1
bass	1
voice	1
entering	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
the	1
countess	1
reflected	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
pinch	1
from	1
a	1
gold	1
snuffbox	1
with	1
her	1

a	1
sad	1

up	1
poor	1

at	1
the	1
razumvskis	1
ball	1
and	1
countess	1
aprksina	1
i	1
was	1
so	1
delighted	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
animated	1
feminine	1
voices	1
interrupting	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
mingling	1
with	1
the	1
rustling	1
of	1
dresses	1
and	1
the	1
scraping	1
of	1
chairs	1
then	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
conversations	1
began	1
which	1
last	1
out	1
until	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
pause	1
the	1
guests	1
rise	1
with	1
a	1
rustle	1
of	1

again	1

into	1
the	1
anteroom	1
put	1
on	1
cloaks	1
or	1
mantles	1
and	1
drive	1
away	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
chief	1
topic	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
illness	1
of	1
the	1
wealthy	1
and	1
celebrated	1
beau	1
of	1
catherines	1
day	1
count	1
bezkhov	1

about	1
his	1
illegitimate	1

the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
behaved	1
so	1
improperly	1
at	1
anna	1
pvlovnas	1
reception	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
count	1
said	1
the	1
visitor	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
bad	1
health	1
and	1
now	1
this	1
vexation	1
about	1
his	1
son	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
kill	1
him	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
asked	1
the	1
countess	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
visitor	1
alluded	1
to	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
about	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
count	1
bezkhovs	1
distress	1
some	1
fifteen	1
times	1
thats	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
a	1
modern	1
education	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
visitor	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
abroad	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
liked	1
now	1
in	1
petersburg	1
i	1
hear	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
doing	1
such	1
terrible	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
expelled	1
by	1
the	1

you	1
dont	1
say	1
so	1
replied	1
the	1

chose	1
his	1

badly	1
interposed	1
anna	1

he	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
dlokhov	1
have	1
it	1
is	1

been	1
up	1
to	1
heaven	1
only	1

what	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
it	1
dlokhov	1
has	1
been	1
degraded	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
and	1
bezkhovs	1
son	1
sent	1
back	1
to	1
moscow	1
anatole	1
kurgins	1
father	1
managed	1
somehow	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
sons	1
affair	1
hushed	1
up	1
but	1
even	1
he	1
was	1
ordered	1
out	1
of	1
petersburg	1
but	1
what	1
have	1
they	1
been	1
up	1
to	1
asked	1
the	1
countess	1
they	1
are	1
regular	1
brigands	1
especially	1
dlokhov	1
replied	1
the	1
visitor	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
mrya	1
ivnovna	1
dlokhova	1
such	1
a	1
worthy	1
woman	1
but	1
there	1
just	1
fancy	1
those	1
three	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
a	1
bear	1
somewhere	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
visit	1
some	1
actresses	1
the	1
police	1
tried	1
to	1
interfere	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
do	1
they	1
tied	1
a	1
policeman	1
and	1
the	1
bear	1
back	1
to	1
back	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
bear	1
into	1
the	1
moyka	1
canal	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
bear	1
swimming	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
policeman	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
what	1
a	1
nice	1
figure	1
the	1
policeman	1
must	1
have	1
cut	1
my	1
dear	1
shouted	1
the	1
count	1
dying	1
with	1
laughter	1
oh	1
how	1
dreadful	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
laugh	1
at	1
it	1
count	1
yet	1
the	1
ladies	1
themselves	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
rescue	1
the	1
poor	1
man	1
continued	1
the	1
visitor	1
and	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
cyril	1
vladmirovich	1
bezkhovs	1
son	1
who	1
amuses	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
sensible	1
manner	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
well	1
educated	1
and	1
clever	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
foreign	1
education	1
has	1
done	1
for	1
him	1
i	1
hope	1
that	1
here	1
in	1
moscow	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
receive	1
him	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
money	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
introduce	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
quite	1
declined	1
i	1
have	1
my	1
daughters	1
to	1
consider	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
so	1
rich	1
asked	1
the	1
countess	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
girls	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
assumed	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
inattention	1
his	1
children	1
are	1
all	1
illegitimate	1
i	1
think	1
pierre	1
also	1
is	1
illegitimate	1
the	1
visitor	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
with	1
her	1
hand	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
them	1
princess	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
intervened	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
connections	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
society	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
said	1
she	1
significantly	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
whisper	1
everyone	1
knows	1
count	1
cyrils	1
reputation	1
he	1
has	1
lost	1
count	1
of	1
his	1
children	1
but	1
this	1
pierre	1
was	1
his	1
favorite	1
how	1
handsome	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
still	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
year	1
ago	1

burst	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
loud	1

again	1

her	1

the	1

compelled	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
at	1
this	1

the	1

mirth	1
that	1

in	1

evidently	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
rooms	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
dashed	1
out	1
so	1
impetuously	1

the	1
contrary	1
at	1

his	1

quietly	1

how	1
he	1

was	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1

shaking	1
with	1
suppressed	1

unable	1

jumped	1
up	1

quietly	1
left	1

went	1
in	1

in	1

coiling	1
twice	1
round	1

by	1
a	1
certain	1

in	1

her	1

under	1

upon	1

evidently	1
concerned	1
with	1
a	1
thought	1
that	1
always	1
occupied	1

now	1
you	1

if	1

far	1
as	1
the	1

her	1

ready	1
to	1
cry	1
at	1
his	1
not	1

from	1

he	1
stood	1

and	1
muttering	1
angrily	1
came	1
in	1
at	1
the	1

natsha	1
checked	1
her	1
first	1
impulse	1

scarcely	1

watched	1
from	1

with	1
sparkling	1

him	1
into	1

among	1
the	1

where	1
she	1

followed	1
her	1
smiling	1
what	1

the	1
something	1
asked	1
he	1
she	1
grew	1
confused	1
glanced	1
round	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1

had	1
thrown	1
down	1
on	1
one	1
of	1

a	1
look	1
of	1
solemnity	1

me	1
would	1

almost	1
inaudibly	1

up	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1

and	1
almost	1
crying	1
from	1

bending	1
down	1
to	1
her	1

blushing	1
still	1
more	1

he	1
waited	1
and	1
did	1
nothing	1
suddenly	1
she	1
jumped	1
up	1
onto	1
a	1

down	1
among	1

properly	1
since	1
she	1
returned	1
from	1
petersburg	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
with	1
her	1
tearworn	1
but	1
pleasant	1
face	1
drew	1
her	1
chair	1
nearer	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
with	1
you	1
i	1
will	1
be	1

frank	1

looked	1
at	1

and	1
paused	1
the	1
countess	1
pressed	1
her	1
friends	1
hand	1
vra	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
not	1
a	1
favorite	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
little	1
tact	1
dont	1
you	1
see	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
wanted	1
here	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
girls	1
or	1
the	1
handsome	1
vra	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
at	1
all	1
hurt	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
sooner	1
mamma	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
she	1
replied	1
as	1
she	1
rose	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
she	1
noticed	1
two	1
couples	1
sitting	1
one	1
pair	1
at	1
each	1
window	1
she	1
stopped	1
and	1
smiled	1
scornfully	1
snya	1
was	1
sitting	1
close	1
to	1
nicholas	1
who	1
was	1
copying	1
out	1
some	1
verses	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
written	1
bors	1
and	1
natsha	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
window	1
and	1
ceased	1
talking	1
when	1
vra	1
entered	1
snya	1
and	1
natsha	1
looked	1
at	1
vra	1
with	1
guilty	1
happy	1
faces	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant	1
and	1
touching	1
to	1
see	1
these	1
little	1
girls	1
in	1
love	1
but	1
apparently	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
them	1
roused	1
no	1
pleasant	1
feeling	1
in	1
vra	1
how	1
often	1
have	1
i	1
asked	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
things	1
she	1
said	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
room	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
inkstand	1
from	1
nicholas	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
he	1
said	1
dipping	1
his	1
pen	1
you	1
always	1
manage	1
to	1
do	1
things	1
at	1
the	1
wrong	1
time	1
continued	1
vra	1
you	1
came	1
rushing	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
so	1
that	1
everyone	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
you	1
though	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
was	1
quite	1
just	1
perhaps	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
no	1
one	1
replied	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
simply	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
she	1
lingered	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
inkstand	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
at	1
your	1
age	1
what	1
secrets	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
between	1
natsha	1
and	1
bors	1
or	1
between	1
you	1
two	1
its	1
all	1
nonsense	1
now	1
vra	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
natsha	1
in	1
defense	1
speaking	1
very	1
gently	1
she	1
seemed	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
kind	1
and	1
affectionate	1
to	1
everyone	1
very	1
silly	1
said	1
vra	1
i	1
am	1
ashamed	1
of	1
you	1
secrets	1
indeed	1
all	1
have	1
secrets	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
answered	1
natsha	1
getting	1
warmer	1
we	1
dont	1
interfere	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
berg	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
not	1
said	1
vra	1
because	1
there	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
anything	1
wrong	1
in	1
my	1
behavior	1
but	1
ill	1
just	1
tell	1

a	1
diplomat	1
that	1

is	1
really	1
tiresome	1
said	1
natsha	1
in	1
a	1
mortified	1
voice	1
that	1
trembled	1
slightly	1
she	1
used	1
the	1
word	1
diplomat	1
which	1
was	1
just	1
then	1
much	1
in	1
vogue	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
special	1
sense	1
they	1
attached	1
to	1
it	1
why	1
does	1
she	1
bother	1
me	1
and	1
she	1
added	1
turning	1
to	1
vra	1
youll	1
never	1

very	1

sadly	1
dropping	1
her	1

my	1

often	1

perhaps	1
its	1
a	1
sin	1
said	1
the	1

what	1
is	1
his	1

worth	1
its	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
brys	1
life	1
is	1
only	1
just	1
beginning	1

will	1
leave	1
something	1
to	1

the	1
countess	1
heaven	1
only	1
knows	1
my	1

go	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
i	1

to	1
him	1
straight	1
out	1

think	1
what	1
they	1
will	1

me	1
its	1

his	1

here	1

to	1
anna	1

he	1
had	1
placed	1
under	1
an	1
obligation	1
assuming	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
much	1

than	1

at	1
the	1
princes	1
brusque	1
manner	1
nor	1
a	1
desire	1

enter	1
into	1

but	1
speaking	1
so	1
quietly	1
and	1
respectfully	1
that	1
the	1

gave	1
him	1
a	1
searching	1
glance	1
are	1
you	1

anna	1
mikhylovna	1
i	1
know	1
i	1
know	1
answered	1
prince	1
vasli	1
in	1
his	1
monotonous	1
voice	1
i	1
never	1
could	1
understand	1
how	1
nataly	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
marry	1
that	1
unlicked	1
bear	1
a	1
perfectly	1
absurd	1
and	1
stupid	1
fellow	1
and	1
a	1
gambler	1
too	1
i	1
am	1
told	1
but	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
man	1
prince	1
said	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
with	1
a	1
pathetic	1
smile	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
too	1
knew	1
that	1
count	1
rostv	1
deserved	1
this	1
censure	1
but	1
asked	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
hard	1
on	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
man	1
what	1
do	1
the	1
doctors	1
say	1
asked	1
the	1
princess	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
her	1
worn	1
face	1
again	1
expressing	1
deep	1
sorrow	1
they	1
give	1
little	1
hope	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
i	1
should	1
so	1
like	1
to	1
thank	1
uncle	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
kindness	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
bors	1
he	1
is	1
his	1
godson	1
she	1
added	1
her	1
tone	1
suggesting	1
that	1
this	1
fact	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
prince	1
vasli	1
much	1
satisfaction	1
prince	1
vasli	1
became	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
frowned	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
finding	1
in	1
her	1
a	1
rival	1
for	1
count	1
bezkhovs	1
fortune	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
reassure	1
him	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
my	1
sincere	1
affection	1
and	1
devotion	1
to	1
uncle	1
said	1
she	1
uttering	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
peculiar	1
assurance	1
and	1
unconcern	1
i	1
know	1
his	1
character	1
noble	1
upright	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
one	1
with	1
him	1
except	1
the	1
young	1
princesses	1
they	1
are	1
still	1
young	1
she	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
continued	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
has	1
he	1
performed	1
his	1
final	1
duty	1
prince	1
how	1
priceless	1
are	1
those	1
last	1
moments	1
it	1
can	1
make	1
things	1
no	1
worse	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
prepare	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
ill	1
we	1
women	1
prince	1
and	1
she	1
smiled	1
tenderly	1
always	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
say	1
these	1
things	1
i	1
absolutely	1
must	1
see	1
him	1
however	1
painful	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
suffering	1
evidently	1
the	1
prince	1
understood	1
her	1
and	1
also	1
understood	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
anna	1
pvlovnas	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
would	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
meeting	1
be	1
too	1
trying	1
for	1
him	1
dear	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
said	1
he	1
let	1
us	1
wait	1
until	1
evening	1
the	1
doctors	1
are	1
expecting	1
a	1
crisis	1
but	1
one	1
cannot	1
delay	1
prince	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
consider	1
that	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
is	1
at	1
stake	1
ah	1
it	1
is	1
awful	1
the	1

strikingly	1
out	1
of	1
proportion	1
to	1
her	1
short	1

prince	1
vasli	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
well	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
but	1
what	1
can	1
you	1
expect	1
this	1
noise	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
looking	1
at	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
stranger	1
ah	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
hardly	1

anna	1

with	1
a	1
happy	1

ambling	1
lightly	1
up	1

imagine	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
gone	1
through	1
and	1
she	1
sympathetically	1
turned	1
up	1
her	1
eyes	1
the	1
princess	1
gave	1
no	1
reply	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
smile	1
but	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
gloves	1
and	1
occupying	1
the	1
position	1
she	1
had	1
conquered	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
inviting	1
prince	1
vasli	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
her	1
bors	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1

with	1
a	1
smile	1
i	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1

my	1

you	1
my	1

had	1
better	1
go	1
to	1

him	1
the	1
rostvs	1

ask	1
him	1

she	1
continued	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
who	1
had	1
plainly	1
become	1
depressed	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
only	1
too	1
glad	1
if	1

scarcely	1

awkwardly	1
as	1
usual	1
but	1
unabashed	1
the	1
count	1
is	1
suffering	1
physically	1
and	1
mentally	1
and	1
apparently	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
your	1
best	1
to	1
increase	1
his	1
mental	1
sufferings	1
can	1

added	1
giving	1
pierre	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
busy	1
and	1
busy	1
making	1
his	1
father	1
comfortable	1
while	1
evidently	1
he	1
pierre	1
was	1
only	1
busy	1
causing	1
him	1
annoyance	1
olga	1
went	1
out	1
pierre	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1

he	1
bowed	1

said	1
then	1
i	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
rooms	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
when	1
i	1
can	1

him	1
and	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room	1

by	1
the	1
low	1

ringing	1
laughter	1
of	1
the	1

the	1

to	1
him	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
behave	1
here	1
as	1
you	1
did	1
in	1
petersburg	1
you	1
will	1
end	1
very	1
badly	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
count	1
is	1
very	1
very	1
ill	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
all	1
since	1
then	1
pierre	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
disturbed	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
rooms	1
upstairs	1
when	1
bors	1
appeared	1
at	1
his	1
door	1
pierre	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
room	1
stopping	1
occasionally	1
at	1
a	1
corner	1
to	1
make	1
menacing	1
gestures	1
at	1
the	1
wall	1
as	1
if	1
running	1
a	1
sword	1
through	1
an	1
invisible	1
foe	1
and	1
glaring	1
savagely	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
resuming	1
his	1
walk	1
muttering	1
indistinct	1
words	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
gesticulating	1
england	1

said	1
he	1
scowling	1
and	1
pointing	1
his	1
finger	1
at	1
someone	1
unseen	1
mr	1

before	1

at	1
that	1

imagined	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
napoleon	1
in	1
person	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
just	1
effected	1
the	1

he	1
saw	1
a	1
wellbuilt	1
and	1
handsome	1
young	1
officer	1
entering	1
his	1
room	1
pierre	1
paused	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
moscow	1
when	1
bors	1
was	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
fourteen	1
and	1
had	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
him	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
impulsive	1
and	1
hearty	1
way	1
he	1
took	1
bors	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
friendly	1
smile	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
me	1
asked	1

quietly	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
i	1
have	1
come	1
with	1
my	1
mother	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count	1

it	1
seems	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
well	1
yes	1
it	1
seems	1
he	1
is	1
ill	1
people	1
are	1
always	1
disturbing	1
him	1
answered	1
pierre	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
who	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
bors	1
felt	1
that	1
pierre	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
him	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
introduce	1
himself	1
and	1
without	1
experiencing	1
the	1
least	1
embarrassment	1
looked	1
pierre	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
count	1
rostv	1
asks	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
today	1
said	1
he	1
after	1
a	1
considerable	1
pause	1
which	1
made	1
pierre	1
feel	1
uncomfortable	1
ah	1
count	1
rostv	1
exclaimed	1
pierre	1
joyfully	1
then	1
you	1
are	1
his	1
son	1
ily	1
only	1
fancy	1
i	1
didnt	1
know	1
you	1
at	1
first	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
sparrow	1
hills	1
with	1
madame	1
jacquot	1
its	1
such	1
an	1
age	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
said	1
bors	1
deliberately	1
with	1
a	1
bold	1
and	1
slightly	1
sarcastic	1
smile	1
i	1
am	1
bors	1
son	1
of	1
princess	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
drubetskya	1
rostv	1
the	1
father	1
is	1
ily	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
is	1
nicholas	1
i	1
never	1
knew	1
any	1
madame	1
jacquot	1
pierre	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
arms	1
as	1
if	1
attacked	1
by	1
mosquitoes	1
or	1
bees	1
oh	1
dear	1
what	1
am	1
i	1
thinking	1
about	1
ive	1
mixed	1
everything	1
up	1
one	1
has	1
so	1
many	1
relatives	1
in	1
moscow	1
so	1
you	1
are	1
bors	1
of	1
course	1
well	1
now	1
we	1
know	1
where	1
we	1
are	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
boulogne	1
expedition	1
the	1
english	1
will	1
come	1
off	1
badly	1
you	1
know	1
if	1
napoleon	1
gets	1
across	1
the	1
channel	1
i	1
think	1
the	1
expedition	1
is	1
quite	1
feasible	1
if	1
only	1
villeneuve	1
doesnt	1
make	1
a	1
mess	1
of	1
things	1
bors	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
the	1
boulogne	1
expedition	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
read	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
villeneuves	1
name	1
we	1
here	1
in	1
moscow	1
are	1
more	1
occupied	1
with	1
dinner	1
parties	1
and	1
scandal	1
than	1
with	1
politics	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
his	1
quiet	1
ironical	1
tone	1
i	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
thought	1
about	1
it	1
moscow	1
is	1
chiefly	1
busy	1
with	1
gossip	1
he	1
continued	1
just	1
now	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
father	1
pierre	1
smiled	1
in	1
his	1
goodnatured	1
way	1
as	1
if	1
afraid	1
for	1
his	1
companions	1
sake	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
might	1
say	1
something	1
he	1
would	1
afterwards	1
regret	1
but	1
bors	1
spoke	1
distinctly	1
clearly	1
and	1
dryly	1
looking	1
straight	1
into	1
pierres	1
eyes	1
moscow	1
has	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
gossip	1
bors	1
went	1
on	1
everybody	1
is	1
wondering	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
count	1
will	1
leave	1
his	1
fortune	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
perhaps	1
outlive	1
us	1
all	1
as	1
i	1
sincerely	1
hope	1
he	1
will	1
yes	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
horrid	1
interrupted	1
pierre	1
very	1
horrid	1
pierre	1
was	1
still	1
afraid	1
that	1
this	1
officer	1
might	1
inadvertently	1
say	1
something	1
disconcerting	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
bors	1
flushing	1
slightly	1
but	1
not	1
changing	1
his	1
tone	1
or	1
attitude	1
it	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
everyone	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
so	1
it	1
does	1
thought	1
pierre	1
but	1
i	1
just	1
wish	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
avoid	1
misunderstandings	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
mistaken	1
if	1
you	1
reckon	1
me	1
or	1
my	1
mother	1
among	1
such	1
people	1
we	1
are	1
very	1
poor	1
but	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
reason	1
that	1
your	1
father	1
is	1
rich	1
i	1
dont	1
regard	1
myself	1
as	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
his	1
and	1
neither	1
i	1
nor	1
my	1
mother	1
would	1
ever	1
ask	1
or	1
take	1
anything	1
from	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
pierre	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sofa	1
seized	1
bors	1
under	1
the	1
elbow	1
in	1
his	1
quick	1
clumsy	1
way	1
and	1
blushing	1
far	1
more	1
than	1
bors	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
mingled	1
shame	1
and	1
vexation	1
well	1
this	1
is	1
strange	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
i	1
who	1
could	1
think	1
i	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
but	1
bors	1
again	1
interrupted	1
him	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
i	1
have	1
spoken	1
out	1
fully	1
perhaps	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
me	1
said	1
he	1
putting	1
pierre	1
at	1
ease	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
put	1
at	1
ease	1
by	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
offended	1
you	1
i	1
always	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
rule	1
to	1
speak	1
out	1
well	1
what	1
answer	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
take	1
will	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
rostvs	1
and	1
bors	1
having	1
apparently	1
relieved	1
himself	1
of	1
an	1
onerous	1
duty	1
and	1
extricated	1
himself	1
from	1
an	1
awkward	1
situation	1
and	1
placed	1
another	1
in	1
it	1
became	1
quite	1
pleasant	1
again	1
no	1
but	1
i	1
say	1
said	1
pierre	1
calming	1
down	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
wonderful	1
fellow	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
said	1
is	1
good	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
dont	1
know	1
me	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
met	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
not	1
since	1
we	1
were	1
children	1
you	1
might	1
think	1
that	1
i	1
i	1
understand	1
quite	1
understand	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
myself	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
courage	1
but	1
its	1
splendid	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
your	1
acquaintance	1
its	1
queer	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
suspected	1
me	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
well	1
what	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
hope	1
well	1
get	1
better	1
acquainted	1
and	1
he	1
pressed	1
bors	1
hand	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
once	1
been	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
sent	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
but	1
what	1
can	1
one	1
do	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
think	1
napoleon	1
will	1
manage	1
to	1
get	1
an	1
army	1
across	1
asked	1
bors	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
bors	1
wished	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
being	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
he	1
began	1
explaining	1
the	1
advantages	1
and	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
the	1
boulogne	1
expedition	1
a	1
footman	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
summon	1
borsthe	1
princess	1
was	1
going	1
pierre	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
make	1
bors	1
better	1
acquaintance	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
and	1
warmly	1
pressing	1
his	1
hand	1
looked	1
affectionately	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
into	1
bors	1
eyes	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
pierre	1
continued	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
no	1
longer	1
piercing	1
an	1
imaginary	1
foe	1
with	1
his	1
imaginary	1
sword	1
but	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
that	1
pleasant	1
intelligent	1
and	1
resolute	1
young	1
man	1
as	1
often	1
happens	1
in	1
early	1
youth	1
especially	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
leads	1
a	1
lonely	1
life	1
he	1
felt	1
an	1
unaccountable	1
tenderness	1
for	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
friends	1
prince	1
vasli	1
saw	1
the	1
princess	1
off	1
she	1
held	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
tearful	1
it	1
is	1
dreadful	1
dreadful	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
but	1
cost	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
may	1
i	1
shall	1
do	1
my	1
duty	1
i	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
like	1
this	1
every	1
moment	1
is	1
precious	1
i	1
cant	1
think	1
why	1
his	1
nieces	1
put	1
it	1
off	1
perhaps	1
god	1
will	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
prepare	1
him	1
adieu	1
prince	1
may	1
god	1
support	1
you	1
adieu	1
ma	1
bonne	1
answered	1
prince	1
vasli	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
oh	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
dreadful	1
state	1
said	1
the	1
mother	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
he	1
hardly	1
recognizes	1
anybody	1
i	1
dont	1
understand	1
mammawhat	1
is	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
pierre	1
asked	1
the	1
son	1
the	1
will	1
will	1
show	1
that	1
my	1
dear	1
our	1
fate	1
also	1
depends	1
on	1
it	1
but	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
expect	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
us	1
anything	1
ah	1
my	1
dear	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
rich	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
so	1
poor	1
well	1
that	1
is	1
hardly	1
a	1
sufficient	1
reason	1
mamma	1
oh	1
heaven	1
how	1

the	1

with	1
a	1
blush	1
that	1
looked	1
very	1
strange	1
on	1
her	1
thin	1
dignified	1
elderly	1
face	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
money	1
from	1

anna	1
mikhylovna	1
instantly	1
guessed	1
her	1
intention	1
and	1
stooped	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
embrace	1
the	1

at	1

already	1
embracing	1
her	1
and	1
weeping	1
the	1
countess	1
wept	1
too	1
they	1
wept	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
friends	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
kindhearted	1
and	1
because	1
theyfriends	1
from	1
childhoodhad	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
such	1
a	1
base	1
thing	1
as	1

at	1
her	1

told	1
good	1

about	1
her	1
while	1

feared	1
her	1
in	1
the	1

full	1
of	1

to	1
the	1

evident	1
pleasure	1

listened	1
to	1
the	1

of	1

though	1
he	1

he	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
up	1
on	1
the	1

as	1
if	1
quite	1
at	1
home	1

into	1

with	1

only	1
want	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
cavalry	1
the	1
advantages	1
are	1
far	1
less	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
infantry	1
just	1
consider	1
my	1
own	1
position	1
now	1
peter	1
nikolevich	1
berg	1
always	1
spoke	1
quietly	1
politely	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
precision	1
his	1
conversation	1
always	1
related	1
entirely	1
to	1
himself	1
he	1
would	1
remain	1
calm	1
and	1
silent	1
when	1
the	1
talk	1
related	1
to	1
any	1
topic	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
direct	1
bearing	1
on	1
himself	1
he	1
could	1
remain	1
silent	1
for	1
hours	1
without	1
being	1
at	1
all	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
countenance	1
himself	1
or	1
making	1
others	1
uncomfortable	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
conversation	1
concerned	1
himself	1
he	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
talk	1
circumstantially	1
and	1
with	1
evident	1
satisfaction	1
consider	1
my	1
position	1
peter	1
nikolevich	1
were	1
i	1
in	1
the	1
cavalry	1
i	1
should	1
get	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
every	1
four	1
months	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
lieutenant	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
receive	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
said	1
he	1
looking	1
at	1
shinshn	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
with	1
a	1
joyful	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
obvious	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
success	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
the	1
chief	1
desire	1
of	1
everyone	1
else	1
besides	1
that	1
peter	1
nikolevich	1
by	1
exchanging	1
into	1
the	1
guards	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
prominent	1
position	1
continued	1
berg	1
and	1
vacancies	1
occur	1
much	1
more	1
frequently	1
in	1
the	1
foot	1
guards	1
then	1
just	1
think	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
rubles	1
i	1
even	1
manage	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
little	1
aside	1
and	1
to	1
send	1
something	1
to	1
my	1

knows	1
how	1
to	1

a	1

as	1
the	1
proverb	1
says	1
remarked	1
shinshn	1
moving	1
his	1
pipe	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
winking	1
at	1
the	1
count	1
so	1
that	1
squares	1
matters	1
the	1
count	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing	1
the	1
other	1
guests	1
seeing	1
that	1
shinshn	1
was	1
talking	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
listen	1
berg	1
oblivious	1
of	1
irony	1
or	1
indifference	1
continued	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
by	1
exchanging	1
into	1
the	1
guards	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
gained	1
a	1
step	1
on	1
his	1
old	1
comrades	1
of	1
the	1
cadet	1
corps	1
how	1
in	1
wartime	1
the	1
company	1
commander	1
might	1
get	1
killed	1
and	1
he	1
as	1
senior	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
might	1
easily	1
succeed	1
to	1
the	1
post	1
how	1
popular	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
how	1
satisfied	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
berg	1
evidently	1
enjoyed	1
narrating	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
suspect	1
that	1
others	1
too	1
might	1
have	1
their	1
own	1
interests	1
but	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
so	1
prettily	1
sedate	1
and	1
the	1
navet	1
of	1
his	1
youthful	1
egotism	1
was	1
so	1
obvious	1
that	1
he	1
disarmed	1
his	1
hearers	1
well	1
my	1
boy	1
youll	1
get	1
along	1
wherever	1
you	1

louder	1

at	1
the	1

fell	1
on	1

that	1
funny	1
lively	1
little	1

look	1
made	1
him	1
inclined	1
to	1
laugh	1
without	1
knowing	1

at	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
snya	1

was	1
again	1
talking	1
with	1
the	1

involuntary	1
smile	1
snya	1
wore	1
a	1
company	1
smile	1
but	1
was	1
evidently	1
tormented	1
by	1
jealousy	1
now	1
she	1
turned	1
pale	1
now	1
blushed	1
and	1
strained	1
every	1
nerve	1
to	1
overhear	1
what	1
nicholas	1

julie	1
were	1
saying	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
the	1

looking	1
round	1
uneasily	1

slight	1
that	1
might	1

upon	1

full	1
description	1
of	1
the	1

the	1

with	1
a	1

wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
napkin	1

him	1
by	1

to	1
appear	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
any	1
of	1
that	1
wine	1
but	1
was	1
mortified	1
because	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
quench	1
his	1
thirst	1
or	1
from	1
greediness	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
it	1

simply	1
from	1

looked	1
round	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
her	1

was	1
not	1
in	1

ran	1
to	1

the	1

dirty	1

on	1
the	1

her	1
gauzy	1
pink	1
dress	1
under	1
her	1
hiding	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
slender	1
fingers	1
and	1
sobbing	1
so	1
convulsively	1
that	1
her	1
bare	1
little	1
shoulders	1
shook	1
natshas	1
face	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
radiantly	1
happy	1
all	1
that	1
saints	1
day	1
suddenly	1
changed	1
her	1
eyes	1
became	1
fixed	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
shiver	1
passed	1
down	1
her	1
broad	1
neck	1
and	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
her	1

and	1
natshas	1
large	1
mouth	1
widened	1
making	1
her	1
look	1
quite	1
ugly	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
wail	1
like	1
a	1
baby	1
without	1
knowing	1
why	1
except	1
that	1
snya	1
was	1
crying	1
snya	1
tried	1
to	1
lift	1
her	1
head	1
to	1

but	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
still	1
deeper	1
in	1
the	1

natsha	1
wept	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
bluestriped	1
feather	1

and	1
hugging	1
her	1
friend	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
snya	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
wiping	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
explaining	1
nicholas	1

going	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
weeks	1

still	1
i	1

and	1
she	1
showed	1
a	1
paper	1
she	1
held	1
in	1
her	1
handwith	1
the	1
verses	1
nicholas	1

written	1

understand	1
what	1
a	1

again	1
because	1

a	1
noble	1

its	1

a	1
little	1
strength	1
he	1

nice	1
there	1

no	1
difficulties	1
in	1

to	1
the	1
metropolitan	1
himself	1
and	1
even	1
then	1
it	1
cant	1
be	1
done	1
and	1
besides	1
if	1

upon	1
the	1
countess	1
as	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
called	1
her	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
spoiling	1
nicholas	1
career	1
and	1
am	1
heartless	1
and	1
ungrateful	1
while	1

and	1
she	1
made	1
the	1

in	1
her	1

in	1
the	1

natsha	1
began	1

her	1

her	1

showed	1
that	1

understood	1
all	1

gravity	1
of	1

in	1
a	1

he	1
offered	1
it	1

a	1

pointing	1
to	1
natsha	1
natsha	1
blushed	1
and	1
laughed	1
well	1

was	1
a	1
clatter	1
of	1

now	1
stretching	1
themselves	1
after	1

so	1
long	1
and	1
replacing	1
their	1

with	1
playful	1
ceremony	1
somewhat	1
in	1
ballet	1
style	1
offered	1
his	1
bent	1

to	1
mrya	1
dmtrievna	1
he	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
debonair	1
gallantry	1
lit	1
up	1
his	1

and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
last	1

of	1
the	1

was	1
ended	1
he	1
clapped	1
his	1

to	1
the	1

and	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
dancing	1
with	1
a	1
grownup	1
partner	1
she	1
bent	1
her	1
curly	1

to	1
her	1

and	1
made	1
the	1

ring	1
with	1
her	1
laughter	1
and	1
indeed	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
looked	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1

gently	1
with	1

and	1
by	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
broadened	1
his	1
round	1
face	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
prepared	1
the	1
onlookers	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
follow	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
provocatively	1
gay	1
strains	1
of	1
daniel	1
cooper	1
somewhat	1
resembling	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
merry	1
peasant	1

began	1
to	1
sound	1
all	1
the	1

only	1
her	1
stern	1

handsome	1

if	1
the	1

getting	1
more	1

into	1
the	1

of	1
it	1
charmed	1
the	1

by	1
the	1

of	1
his	1
adroit	1

chair	1
in	1
the	1

with	1
unusually	1
hurried	1
steps	1
down	1
the	1

of	1

silent	1

gazed	1
with	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
curiosity	1
or	1
expectancy	1
at	1

creaked	1
slightly	1
when	1

put	1
a	1

a	1

a	1
severely	1
negative	1
finger	1
before	1
his	1
nose	1
tonight	1
not	1
later	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
decorous	1
smile	1
of	1
selfsatisfaction	1
at	1
being	1
able	1
clearly	1
to	1
understand	1
and	1
state	1
the	1
patients	1
condition	1
meanwhile	1
prince	1
vasli	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
princess	1
room	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
dark	1
only	1
two	1
tiny	1
lamps	1
were	1
burning	1
before	1
the	1
icons	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
pleasant	1
scent	1
of	1
flowers	1
and	1
burnt	1
pastilles	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
crowded	1
with	1
small	1
pieces	1
of	1
furniture	1
whatnots	1
cupboards	1
and	1
little	1
tables	1
the	1
quilt	1
of	1
a	1
high	1
white	1
feather	1
bed	1
was	1
just	1
visible	1
behind	1
a	1
screen	1
a	1
small	1
dog	1
began	1
to	1
bark	1
ah	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
cousin	1
she	1
rose	1
and	1
smoothed	1
her	1
hair	1
which	1
was	1
as	1
usual	1
so	1
extremely	1
smooth	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
one	1
piece	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
varnish	1

came	1
to	1

a	1
talk	1
about	1

muttered	1
the	1
prince	1
seating	1
himself	1
wearily	1
on	1
the	1
chair	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
vacated	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
place	1
warm	1

say	1
he	1
remarked	1
well	1

a	1
talk	1
catherine	1
i	1
thought	1
perhaps	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
her	1
unchanging	1
stonily	1
severe	1
expression	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
opposite	1
the	1
prince	1
she	1
prepared	1
to	1
listen	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
nap	1
mon	1
cousin	1
but	1
i	1
cant	1
well	1
my	1
dear	1
said	1
prince	1
vasli	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
bending	1
it	1
downwards	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
habit	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
this	1
well	1
referred	1
to	1
much	1
that	1
they	1
both	1
understood	1
without	1
naming	1
the	1
princess	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
straight	1
rigid	1
body	1
abnormally	1
long	1
for	1
her	1
legs	1
looked	1
directly	1
at	1
prince	1
vasli	1
with	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
emotion	1
in	1
her	1
prominent	1
gray	1
eyes	1
then	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
glanced	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
icons	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
this	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
as	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
devotion	1
or	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
hope	1
of	1
resting	1
before	1
long	1
prince	1
vasli	1
understood	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
i	1
he	1
said	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
as	1
worn	1
out	1
as	1
a	1
post	1
horse	1
but	1
still	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
you	1
catiche	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
talk	1
prince	1
vasli	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
his	1
cheeks	1
began	1
to	1
twitch	1
nervously	1
now	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
giving	1
his	1
face	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
expression	1
which	1
was	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
on	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
drawing	1
room	1
his	1
eyes	1
too	1
seemed	1
strange	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
they	1
looked	1
impudently	1
sly	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
glanced	1
round	1
in	1
alarm	1
the	1
princess	1
holding	1
her	1
little	1
dog	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
with	1
her	1
thin	1
bony	1
hands	1
looked	1
attentively	1
into	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
eyes	1
evidently	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
break	1
silence	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
morning	1
well	1
you	1
see	1
my	1
dear	1
princess	1
and	1
cousin	1
catherine	1
semnovna	1
continued	1
prince	1
vasli	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
theme	1
apparently	1
not	1
without	1
an	1
inner	1
struggle	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
as	1
this	1
one	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
everything	1
one	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
of	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
i	1
love	1
you	1
all	1
like	1
children	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
princess	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
moving	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
dull	1
expression	1
and	1
then	1
of	1
course	1
my	1
family	1
has	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
prince	1
vasli	1
went	1
on	1
testily	1
pushing	1
away	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
you	1
know	1
catiche	1
that	1
weyou	1
three	1
sisters	1
mmontov	1
and	1
my	1
wifeare	1
the	1
counts	1
only	1
direct	1
heirs	1
i	1
know	1
i	1
know	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
matters	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
easier	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
am	1
getting	1
on	1
for	1
sixty	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
anything	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
pierre	1
the	1
count	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
portrait	1
definitely	1
demanded	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
called	1
prince	1
vasli	1
looked	1
questioningly	1
at	1
the	1
princess	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
considering	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
said	1
or	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
simply	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
i	1
constantly	1
pray	1
god	1
to	1
grant	1
mon	1
cousin	1
she	1
replied	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
would	1
allow	1
his	1
noble	1
soul	1
peacefully	1
to	1
leave	1
this	1
yes	1
yes	1
of	1
course	1
interrupted	1
prince	1
vasli	1
impatiently	1
rubbing	1
his	1
bald	1
head	1
and	1
angrily	1
pulling	1
back	1
toward	1
him	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
pushed	1
away	1
but	1
in	1
short	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
you	1
know	1
yourself	1
that	1
last	1
winter	1
the	1
count	1
made	1
a	1
will	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
left	1
all	1
his	1
property	1
not	1
to	1
us	1
his	1
direct	1
heirs	1
but	1
to	1
pierre	1
he	1
has	1
made	1
wills	1
enough	1
quietly	1
remarked	1
the	1
princess	1
but	1
he	1
cannot	1
leave	1
the	1
estate	1
to	1
pierre	1
pierre	1
is	1
illegitimate	1
but	1
my	1
dear	1
said	1
prince	1
vasli	1
suddenly	1
clutching	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
and	1
becoming	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
talking	1
more	1
rapidly	1
what	1
if	1
a	1
letter	1
has	1
been	1
written	1
to	1
the	1
emperor	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
count	1
asks	1
for	1
pierres	1
legitimation	1
do	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
in	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
counts	1
services	1
his	1
request	1
would	1
be	1
granted	1
the	1
princess	1
smiled	1
as	1
people	1
do	1
who	1
think	1
they	1
know	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
subject	1
under	1
discussion	1
than	1
those	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
with	1
i	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
more	1
continued	1
prince	1
vasli	1
seizing	1
her	1
hand	1
that	1
letter	1
was	1
written	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
sent	1
and	1
the	1
emperor	1
knew	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
only	1
question	1
is	1
has	1
it	1
been	1
destroyed	1
or	1
not	1
if	1
not	1
then	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
all	1
is	1
over	1
and	1
prince	1
vasli	1
sighed	1
to	1
intimate	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
the	1
words	1
all	1
is	1
over	1
and	1
the	1
counts	1
papers	1
are	1
opened	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
letter	1
will	1
be	1
delivered	1
to	1
the	1
emperor	1
and	1
the	1
petition	1
will	1
certainly	1
be	1
granted	1
pierre	1
will	1
get	1
everything	1
as	1
the	1
legitimate	1
son	1
and	1
our	1
share	1
asked	1
the	1
princess	1
smiling	1
ironically	1
as	1
if	1
anything	1
might	1
happen	1
only	1
not	1
that	1
but	1
my	1
poor	1
catiche	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
daylight	1
he	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
the	1
legal	1
heir	1
to	1
everything	1
and	1
you	1
wont	1
get	1
anything	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
my	1
dear	1
whether	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
letter	1
were	1
written	1
and	1
whether	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
destroyed	1
or	1
not	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
somehow	1
been	1
overlooked	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
must	1
find	1
them	1
because	1
what	1
next	1
the	1
princess	1
interrupted	1
smiling	1
sardonically	1
and	1
not	1
changing	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
woman	1
and	1
you	1
think	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
stupid	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
this	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
cannot	1
inherit	1
un	1
btard	1
she	1
added	1
as	1
if	1
supposing	1
that	1
this	1
translation	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
would	1
effectively	1
prove	1
to	1
prince	1
vasli	1
the	1
invalidity	1
of	1
his	1
contention	1
a	1
bastard	1
well	1
really	1
catiche	1
cant	1
you	1
understand	1

to	1
the	1
emperor	1
begging	1
him	1
to	1
recognize	1

in	1
the	1

ideas	1
her	1
thin	1

grew	1
white	1

her	1

when	1

of	1
one	1

with	1
a	1
sigh	1
i	1
shall	1
always	1
remember	1
that	1
in	1
this	1

a	1

a	1

shrieked	1
the	1
princess	1
now	1
quite	1
changed	1
and	1
what	1

herself	1

chapter	1
xxii	1
while	1
these	1
conversations	1
were	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
room	1
a	1
carriage	1
containing	1
pierre	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
for	1
and	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
who	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
accompany	1
him	1
was	1
driving	1
into	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
count	1
bezkhovs	1
house	1
as	1
the	1
wheels	1
rolled	1
softly	1
over	1
the	1
straw	1
beneath	1
the	1
windows	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
having	1
turned	1
with	1
words	1
of	1
comfort	1
to	1
her	1
companion	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
asleep	1
in	1
his	1
corner	1
and	1
woke	1
him	1
up	1
rousing	1
himself	1
pierre	1
followed	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
interview	1
with	1
his	1
dying	1
father	1
which	1
awaited	1
him	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
entrance	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
door	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
getting	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
steps	1
two	1
men	1
who	1
looked	1
like	1
tradespeople	1
ran	1
hurriedly	1
from	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
pausing	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
pierre	1
noticed	1
several	1
other	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
hiding	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
but	1
neither	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
nor	1
the	1
footman	1
nor	1
the	1
coachman	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
these	1
people	1
took	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
them	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
right	1
pierre	1
concluded	1
and	1
followed	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
she	1
hurriedly	1
ascended	1
the	1
narrow	1
dimly	1
lit	1
stone	1
staircase	1
calling	1
to	1
pierre	1
who	1
was	1
lagging	1
behind	1
to	1
follow	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
at	1
all	1
still	1
less	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
stairs	1
yet	1
judging	1
by	1
anna	1
mikhylovnas	1
air	1
of	1
assurance	1
and	1
haste	1
pierre	1
concluded	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
halfway	1
up	1
the	1
stairs	1
they	1
were	1
almost	1
knocked	1
over	1
by	1
some	1
men	1
who	1
carrying	1
pails	1
came	1
running	1
downstairs	1
their	1
boots	1
clattering	1
these	1
men	1
pressed	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
to	1
let	1
pierre	1
and	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
pass	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
evince	1
the	1
least	1
surprise	1
at	1
seeing	1
them	1
there	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
princesses	1
apartments	1
asked	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
yes	1
replied	1
a	1
footman	1
in	1
a	1
bold	1
loud	1
voice	1
as	1
if	1
anything	1
were	1
now	1
permissible	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
maam	1
perhaps	1
the	1
count	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
for	1
me	1
said	1
pierre	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
landing	1
id	1
better	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
room	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
paused	1
and	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
ah	1
my	1
friend	1
she	1
said	1
touching	1
his	1
arm	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
sons	1
when	1
speaking	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
afternoon	1
believe	1
me	1
i	1
suffer	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
you	1
do	1
but	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
but	1
really	1
hadnt	1
i	1
better	1
go	1
away	1
he	1
asked	1
looking	1
kindly	1
at	1
her	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
ah	1
my	1
dear	1
friend	1
forget	1
the	1
wrongs	1
that	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
father	1
perhaps	1
in	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
death	1
she	1
sighed	1
i	1
have	1
loved	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
son	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
trust	1
yourself	1
to	1
me	1
pierre	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
forget	1
your	1
interests	1
pierre	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
a	1
word	1
but	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
grew	1
stronger	1
and	1
he	1
meekly	1
followed	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
opening	1
a	1
door	1
this	1
door	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
back	1
anteroom	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
princesses	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
knitting	1
a	1
stocking	1
pierre	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
these	1
rooms	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
addressing	1
a	1
maid	1
who	1
was	1
hurrying	1
past	1
with	1
a	1
decanter	1
on	1
a	1
tray	1
as	1
my	1
dear	1
and	1
my	1
sweet	1
asked	1
about	1
the	1
princess	1
health	1
and	1
then	1
led	1
pierre	1
along	1
a	1
stone	1
passage	1
the	1
first	1
door	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
princesses	1
apartments	1
the	1
maid	1
with	1
the	1
decanter	1
in	1
her	1
haste	1
had	1
not	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
haste	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
pierre	1
and	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
in	1
passing	1
instinctively	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
prince	1
vasli	1
and	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
were	1
sitting	1
close	1
together	1
talking	1
seeing	1
them	1
pass	1
prince	1
vasli	1
drew	1
back	1
with	1
obvious	1
impatience	1
while	1
the	1
princess	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
desperation	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
might	1
this	1
action	1
was	1
so	1
unlike	1
her	1
usual	1
composure	1
and	1
the	1
fear	1
depicted	1
on	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
face	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
his	1
dignity	1
that	1
pierre	1
stopped	1
and	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
at	1
his	1
guide	1

mikhylovna	1
evinced	1
no	1
surprise	1
she	1
only	1
smiled	1
faintly	1
and	1
sighed	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
my	1
friend	1
i	1
will	1
look	1
after	1
your	1
interests	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
look	1
and	1
went	1
still	1
faster	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
pierre	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
about	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
what	1
watching	1
over	1
his	1
interests	1
meant	1
but	1
he	1
decided	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
from	1
the	1
passage	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
dimly	1
lit	1
room	1
adjoining	1
the	1
counts	1
reception	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
sumptuous	1
but	1
cold	1
apartments	1
known	1
to	1
pierre	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
front	1
approach	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
there	1
now	1
stood	1
an	1
empty	1
bath	1
and	1
water	1
had	1
been	1
spilled	1
on	1
the	1
carpet	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
by	1
a	1
deacon	1
with	1
a	1
censer	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
servant	1
who	1
passed	1
out	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
without	1
heeding	1
them	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
familiar	1
to	1
pierre	1
with	1
two	1
italian	1
windows	1
opening	1
into	1
the	1
conservatory	1
with	1
its	1
large	1
bust	1
and	1
full	1
length	1
portrait	1
of	1
catherine	1
the	1
great	1
the	1
same	1
people	1
were	1
still	1
sitting	1
here	1
in	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
positions	1
as	1
before	1
whispering	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
all	1
became	1
silent	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
pale	1
tearworn	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
big	1
stout	1
figure	1
of	1
pierre	1
who	1
hanging	1
his	1
head	1
meekly	1
followed	1
her	1
anna	1
mikhylovnas	1
face	1
expressed	1
a	1
consciousness	1
that	1
the	1
decisive	1
moment	1
had	1
arrived	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
practical	1
petersburg	1
lady	1
she	1
now	1
keeping	1
pierre	1
close	1
beside	1
her	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
even	1
more	1
boldly	1
than	1
that	1
afternoon	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
as	1
she	1
brought	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
person	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
own	1
admission	1
was	1
assured	1
casting	1
a	1
rapid	1
glance	1
at	1
all	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
noticing	1
the	1
counts	1
confessor	1
there	1
she	1
glided	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
amble	1
not	1
exactly	1
bowing	1
yet	1
seeming	1
to	1
grow	1
suddenly	1
smaller	1
and	1
respectfully	1
received	1
the	1
blessing	1
first	1
of	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
of	1
another	1
priest	1
god	1
be	1
thanked	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
time	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
all	1
we	1
relatives	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
such	1
anxiety	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
counts	1
son	1
she	1
added	1
more	1
softly	1
what	1
a	1
terrible	1
moment	1
having	1
said	1
this	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
dear	1
doctor	1
said	1
she	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
counts	1
son	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
hope	1
the	1
doctor	1
cast	1
a	1
rapid	1
glance	1
upwards	1
and	1
silently	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
with	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
movement	1
raised	1
her	1
shoulders	1
and	1
eyes	1
almost	1
closing	1
the	1
latter	1
sighed	1
and	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
doctor	1
to	1
pierre	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
particularly	1
respectful	1
and	1
tenderly	1
sad	1
voice	1
she	1
said	1
trust	1
in	1
his	1
mercy	1
and	1
pointing	1
out	1
a	1
small	1
sofa	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
sit	1
and	1
wait	1
for	1
her	1
she	1
went	1
silently	1
toward	1
the	1
door	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
watching	1
and	1
it	1
creaked	1
very	1
slightly	1
as	1
she	1
disappeared	1
behind	1
it	1
pierre	1
having	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
obey	1
his	1
monitress	1
implicitly	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
sofa	1
she	1
had	1
indicated	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
had	1
disappeared	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
curiosity	1
and	1
sympathy	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
whispered	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
casting	1
significant	1
looks	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
awe	1
and	1
even	1
servility	1
a	1
deference	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
received	1
was	1
shown	1
him	1
a	1
strange	1
lady	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
priests	1
rose	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
her	1
seat	1
an	1
aidedecamp	1
picked	1
up	1
and	1
returned	1
a	1
glove	1
pierre	1
had	1
dropped	1
the	1
doctors	1
became	1
respectfully	1
silent	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
by	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
him	1
at	1
first	1
pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
another	1
seat	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
trouble	1
the	1
lady	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
glove	1
himself	1
and	1
to	1
pass	1
round	1
the	1
doctors	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
but	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
and	1
that	1
tonight	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
person	1
obliged	1
to	1
perform	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
awful	1
rite	1
which	1
everyone	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
therefore	1
bound	1
to	1
accept	1
their	1
services	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
glove	1
in	1
silence	1
from	1
the	1
aidedecamp	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
ladys	1
chair	1
placing	1
his	1
huge	1
hands	1
symmetrically	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
in	1
the	1
nave	1
attitude	1
of	1
an	1
egyptian	1
statue	1
and	1
decided	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
do	1
foolish	1
things	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
act	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
ideas	1
tonight	1
but	1
must	1
yield	1
himself	1
up	1
entirely	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
guiding	1
him	1
not	1
two	1
minutes	1
had	1
passed	1
before	1
prince	1
vasli	1
with	1
head	1
erect	1
majestically	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
was	1
wearing	1
his	1
long	1
coat	1
with	1
three	1
stars	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
grown	1
thinner	1
since	1
the	1
morning	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
larger	1
than	1
usual	1
when	1
he	1
glanced	1
round	1
and	1
noticed	1
pierre	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
thing	1
he	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
drew	1
it	1
downwards	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
ascertain	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
firmly	1
fixed	1
on	1
courage	1
courage	1
my	1
friend	1
he	1
has	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
that	1
is	1
well	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
go	1
but	1
pierre	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
ask	1
how	1
is	1
and	1
hesitated	1
not	1
knowing	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
proper	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
the	1
count	1
yet	1
ashamed	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
father	1
he	1
had	1
another	1
stroke	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
courage	1
my	1
friend	1
pierres	1
mind	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
confused	1
state	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
stroke	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
blow	1
from	1
something	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
prince	1
vasli	1
in	1
perplexity	1
and	1
only	1
later	1
grasped	1
that	1
a	1
stroke	1
was	1
an	1
attack	1
of	1
illness	1
prince	1
vasli	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
lorrain	1
in	1
passing	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
walk	1
well	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
jerked	1
at	1
each	1
step	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
followed	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
deacons	1
and	1
some	1
servants	1
also	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
through	1
that	1
door	1
was	1
heard	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
things	1
being	1
moved	1
about	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
still	1
with	1
the	1

expression	1
pale	1
but	1
resolute	1
in	1
the	1

ran	1
out	1

in	1
at	1
the	1

on	1
the	1

that	1
the	1

the	1

some	1
of	1
the	1

all	1

with	1
that	1

of	1

above	1
his	1
broad	1

reminded	1

of	1

the	1
deep	1

of	1

silently	1
crossing	1
themselves	1

of	1
the	1

the	1
subdued	1
chanting	1
of	1

in	1
the	1

the	1
only	1
sounds	1

heard	1
anna	1

with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1

she	1
was	1
about	1
went	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
where	1
pierre	1
was	1
standing	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
taper	1
he	1
lit	1
it	1
and	1
distracted	1
by	1
observing	1
those	1
around	1
him	1
began	1

himself	1
with	1

hid	1
her	1

in	1
her	1

remained	1
with	1

hidden	1
for	1
awhile	1

looking	1
up	1
and	1
seeing	1
pierre	1
she	1
again	1

to	1
laugh	1
she	1
evidently	1
felt	1
unable	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
laughing	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
so	1
to	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
temptation	1
she	1
slipped	1
quietly	1
behind	1

they	1
whispered	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
servant	1
who	1
was	1

up	1

he	1
was	1
leaning	1
against	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
columns	1
in	1
a	1
respectful	1
attitude	1
implying	1
that	1
he	1
a	1
foreigner	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
differences	1
of	1
faith	1
understood	1
the	1
full	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
rite	1
now	1
being	1
performed	1
and	1
even	1
approved	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
now	1
approached	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
noiseless	1
step	1
of	1
one	1
in	1
full	1
vigor	1
of	1
life	1
with	1
his	1
delicate	1
white	1
fingers	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
green	1
quilt	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
was	1
free	1
and	1
turning	1
sideways	1
felt	1
the	1

reflected	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
given	1
something	1
to	1
drink	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
around	1
him	1

the	1

resumed	1
their	1
places	1
and	1
the	1

during	1
this	1
interval	1
pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
prince	1
vasli	1
left	1
the	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
leaning	1
andwith	1
an	1
air	1
which	1
intimated	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
and	1
if	1
others	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1

not	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
but	1
passed	1
by	1

joined	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
and	1
moved	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
stood	1
the	1
high	1
bedstead	1
with	1
its	1
silken	1
hangings	1
on	1
leaving	1
the	1

both	1

the	1

out	1

returned	1

after	1

was	1
concluded	1
pierre	1
paid	1
no	1
more	1
attention	1
to	1
this	1
occurrence	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
having	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
happening	1
around	1
him	1
that	1
evening	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
essential	1
the	1
chanting	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
ceased	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
priest	1
was	1
heard	1
respectfully	1
congratulating	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
on	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
sacrament	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
lay	1
as	1
lifeless	1
and	1
immovable	1
as	1
before	1
around	1
him	1
everyone	1
began	1
to	1
stir	1
steps	1
were	1
audible	1
and	1
whispers	1
among	1
which	1
anna	1
mikhylovnas	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
distinct	1
pierre	1
heard	1
her	1
say	1
certainly	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
moved	1
onto	1
the	1
bed	1
here	1
it	1
will	1

the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
so	1
surrounded	1
by	1
doctors	1
princesses	1

servants	1
that	1
pierre	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
see	1
the	1
reddishyellow	1

with	1
its	1
gray	1

he	1
saw	1
other	1
faces	1

well	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
moment	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
service	1
he	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
cautious	1
movements	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
crowded	1
round	1
the	1
invalid	1
chair	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
lifted	1
the	1

were	1
moving	1

heard	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
say	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
whisper	1
catch	1
hold	1
from	1
underneath	1
here	1
exclaimed	1
different	1
voices	1
and	1
the	1
heavy	1
breathing	1
of	1
the	1
bearers	1
and	1
the	1
shuffling	1
of	1
their	1
feet	1
grew	1
more	1
hurried	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
weight	1
they	1
were	1
carrying	1
were	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
bearers	1
among	1
whom	1
was	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
passed	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
momentary	1
glimpse	1
between	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
backs	1
of	1
the	1
dying	1
mans	1
high	1
stout	1
uncovered	1
chest	1
and	1
powerful	1
shoulders	1
raised	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
holding	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
armpits	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
gray	1
curly	1
leonine	1
head	1
this	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
remarkably	1
broad	1
brow	1
and	1
cheekbones	1
its	1
handsome	1
sensual	1
mouth	1
and	1
its	1
cold	1
majestic	1
expression	1
was	1
not	1
disfigured	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
death	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
pierre	1
remembered	1
it	1
three	1
months	1
before	1
when	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
petersburg	1
but	1
now	1
this	1
head	1
was	1
swaying	1
helplessly	1
with	1
the	1
uneven	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
bearers	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
listless	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
itself	1
upon	1
nothing	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
bustle	1
beside	1
the	1
high	1
bedstead	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
dispersed	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
touched	1
pierres	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
come	1
pierre	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
laid	1
in	1
a	1
stately	1
pose	1
in	1
keeping	1
with	1
the	1
ceremony	1
just	1
completed	1
he	1
lay	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
propped	1
high	1
on	1
the	1
pillows	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
symmetrically	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
green	1
silk	1
quilt	1
the	1
palms	1
downward	1
when	1
pierre	1
came	1
up	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
gazing	1
straight	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
understood	1
by	1
mortal	1
man	1
either	1
this	1
look	1
meant	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
one	1
has	1
eyes	1
they	1
must	1
look	1
somewhere	1
or	1
it	1
meant	1
too	1
much	1
pierre	1
hesitated	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
guide	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
made	1
a	1
hurried	1
sign	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
sick	1
mans	1
hand	1
and	1
moving	1
her	1
lips	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
send	1
it	1
a	1
kiss	1
pierre	1
carefully	1
stretching	1
his	1
neck	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
quilt	1
followed	1
her	1
suggestion	1
and	1
pressed	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
boned	1
fleshy	1
hand	1
neither	1
the	1
hand	1
nor	1
a	1
single	1
muscle	1
of	1
the	1
counts	1
face	1
stirred	1
once	1
more	1
pierre	1
looked	1
questioningly	1
at	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
next	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
indicated	1
a	1
chair	1
that	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
bed	1
pierre	1
obediently	1
sat	1
down	1
his	1
eyes	1
asking	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
doing	1
right	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
nodded	1
approvingly	1
again	1
pierre	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
navely	1
symmetrical	1
pose	1
of	1
an	1
egyptian	1
statue	1
evidently	1
distressed	1
that	1
his	1
stout	1
and	1
clumsy	1
body	1
took	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
room	1
and	1
doing	1
his	1
utmost	1
to	1
look	1
as	1
small	1
as	1
possible	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
count	1
who	1
still	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
pierres	1
face	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
indicated	1
by	1
her	1
attitude	1
her	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
pathetic	1
importance	1
of	1
these	1
last	1
moments	1
of	1
meeting	1
between	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
son	1
this	1
lasted	1
about	1
two	1
minutes	1
which	1
to	1
pierre	1
seemed	1
an	1
hour	1
suddenly	1
the	1
broad	1
muscles	1
and	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
counts	1
face	1
began	1
to	1
twitch	1
the	1
twitching	1
increased	1
the	1
handsome	1
mouth	1
was	1
drawn	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
only	1
now	1
did	1
pierre	1
realize	1
how	1
near	1
death	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
distorted	1
mouth	1
issued	1
an	1
indistinct	1
hoarse	1
sound	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
looked	1
attentively	1
at	1
the	1
sick	1
mans	1
eyes	1
trying	1
to	1
guess	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
she	1
pointed	1
first	1
to	1
pierre	1
then	1
to	1
some	1
drink	1
then	1
named	1
prince	1
vasli	1
in	1
an	1
inquiring	1
whisper	1
then	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
quilt	1
the	1
eyes	1
and	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
showed	1
impatience	1
he	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
stood	1
constantly	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
wants	1
to	1
turn	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
whispered	1
the	1
servant	1
and	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
counts	1
heavy	1
body	1
toward	1
the	1
wall	1
pierre	1
rose	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
while	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
being	1
turned	1
over	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
arms	1
fell	1
back	1
helplessly	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
fruitless	1
effort	1
to	1
pull	1
it	1
forward	1
whether	1
he	1
noticed	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
terror	1
with	1
which	1
pierre	1
regarded	1
that	1
lifeless	1
arm	1
or	1
whether	1
some	1
other	1
thought	1
flitted	1
across	1
his	1
dying	1
brain	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
refractory	1
arm	1
at	1
pierres	1
terrorstricken	1
face	1
and	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
a	1
feeble	1
piteous	1
smile	1
appeared	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
his	1
features	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
deride	1
his	1
own	1
helplessness	1
at	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
smile	1
pierre	1
felt	1
an	1
unexpected	1
quivering	1
in	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
a	1
tickling	1
in	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
tears	1
dimmed	1
his	1
eyes	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
turned	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
side	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
he	1
sighed	1
he	1
is	1
dozing	1
said	1

observing	1
that	1

nothing	1
merely	1
giving	1
his	1
arm	1
a	1
sympathetic	1
squeeze	1
below	1
the	1
shoulder	1
pierre	1
went	1
with	1
anna	1

into	1
the	1
small	1

there	1
is	1
nothing	1
so	1
refreshing	1
after	1
a	1

night	1
as	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
this	1
delicious	1
russian	1
tea	1

was	1
saying	1
with	1
an	1

stood	1
sipping	1
tea	1
from	1
a	1
delicate	1
chinese	1
handleless	1
cup	1
before	1
a	1
table	1
on	1

supper	1
were	1
laid	1
in	1

this	1
small	1
circular	1

room	1
with	1
its	1
mirrors	1

little	1
tables	1
during	1
balls	1
given	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
pierre	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
dance	1
had	1
liked	1
sitting	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
ladies	1
who	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
in	1
their	1
ball	1
dresses	1
with	1
diamonds	1
and	1
pearls	1
on	1
their	1
bare	1
shoulders	1
looked	1
at	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
brilliantly	1
lighted	1
mirrors	1
which	1
repeated	1
their	1
reflections	1
several	1
times	1
now	1

by	1

in	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
night	1
a	1
motley	1
throng	1
of	1
people	1
sat	1
there	1
not	1
merrymaking	1

somberly	1
whispering	1
and	1
betraying	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
movement	1
that	1
they	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
forgot	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1

what	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
happen	1
in	1
the	1

did	1
not	1
eat	1
anything	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
very	1
much	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
he	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
monitress	1

saw	1
that	1

was	1
again	1
going	1
on	1

to	1
the	1

room	1
where	1
they	1

left	1

after	1

short	1
interval	1
followed	1
her	1

mikhylovna	1
was	1
standing	1
beside	1
the	1

excited	1
whispers	1

me	1
princess	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
necessary	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
not	1

said	1
the	1
younger	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
speakers	1
evidently	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
as	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
her	1
room	1
but	1
my	1
dear	1
princess	1
answered	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
blandly	1
but	1
impressively	1
blocking	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
and	1
preventing	1
the	1
other	1
from	1
passing	1
wont	1
this	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
poor	1
uncle	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
needs	1
repose	1
worldly	1
conversation	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
his	1
soul	1
is	1
already	1
prepared	1
prince	1
vasli	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
in	1
his	1
familiar	1
attitude	1
with	1
one	1
leg	1
crossed	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
other	1
his	1
cheeks	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
flabby	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
heavier	1
below	1
were	1
twitching	1
violently	1
but	1
he	1
wore	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
little	1
concerned	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
were	1
saying	1
come	1
my	1
dear	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
let	1
catiche	1
do	1
as	1
she	1
pleases	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
fond	1
the	1
count	1
is	1
of	1
her	1
i	1
dont	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
paper	1
said	1
the	1
younger	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
addressing	1
prince	1
vasli	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
an	1
inlaid	1
portfolio	1
she	1
held	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
all	1
i	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
his	1
real	1
will	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
writing	1
table	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
paper	1
he	1
has	1
forgotten	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
pass	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
sprang	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
bar	1
her	1
path	1
i	1
know	1
my	1
dear	1
kind	1
princess	1
said	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
seizing	1
the	1
portfolio	1
so	1
firmly	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
go	1
easily	1
dear	1
princess	1
i	1
beg	1
and	1
implore	1
you	1
have	1
some	1
pity	1
on	1
him	1
je	1
vous	1
en	1
conjure	1
the	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
their	1
efforts	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
the	1
portfolio	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
sounds	1
audible	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
princess	1
did	1
speak	1
her	1
words	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
flattering	1
to	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
though	1
the	1
latter	1
held	1
on	1
tenaciously	1
her	1
voice	1
lost	1
none	1
of	1
its	1
honeyed	1
firmness	1
and	1
softness	1
pierre	1
my	1
dear	1
come	1
here	1
i	1
think	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
in	1
a	1
family	1
consultation	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
prince	1
why	1
dont	1
you	1
speak	1
cousin	1
suddenly	1
shrieked	1
the	1
princess	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
heard	1
her	1
and	1
were	1
startled	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
remain	1
silent	1
when	1
heaven	1
knows	1
who	1
permits	1
herself	1
to	1
interfere	1
making	1
a	1
scene	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
threshold	1
of	1
a	1
dying	1
mans	1
room	1
intriguer	1
she	1
hissed	1
viciously	1
and	1
tugged	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
might	1
at	1
the	1
portfolio	1
but	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
went	1
forward	1
a	1
step	1
or	1
two	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
portfolio	1
and	1
changed	1
her	1
grip	1
prince	1
vasli	1
rose	1
oh	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
reproach	1
and	1
surprise	1
this	1
is	1
absurd	1
come	1
let	1
go	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
princess	1
let	1
go	1
and	1
you	1
too	1
but	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
did	1
not	1
obey	1
him	1
let	1
go	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
i	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
responsibility	1
i	1
myself	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
ask	1
him	1
i	1
does	1
that	1
satisfy	1
you	1
but	1
prince	1
said	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
after	1
such	1
a	1
solemn	1
sacrament	1
allow	1
him	1
a	1
moments	1
peace	1
here	1
pierre	1
tell	1
them	1
your	1
opinion	1
said	1
she	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
having	1
come	1
quite	1
close	1
was	1
gazing	1
with	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
angry	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
which	1
had	1
lost	1
all	1
dignity	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
twitching	1
cheeks	1
of	1
prince	1
vasli	1
remember	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
answer	1
for	1
the	1
consequences	1
said	1
prince	1
vasli	1
severely	1
you	1
dont	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
doing	1
vile	1
woman	1
shouted	1
the	1
princess	1
darting	1
unexpectedly	1
at	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
and	1
snatching	1
the	1
portfolio	1
from	1
her	1
prince	1
vasli	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
hands	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
that	1
terrible	1
door	1
which	1
pierre	1
had	1
watched	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
opened	1
so	1
quietly	1
burst	1
noisily	1
open	1
and	1
banged	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
sisters	1
rushed	1
out	1
wringing	1
her	1
hands	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
she	1
cried	1
vehemently	1
he	1
is	1
dying	1
and	1
you	1
leave	1
me	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
her	1
sister	1
dropped	1
the	1
portfolio	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
stooping	1
quickly	1
caught	1
up	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
contention	1
and	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
and	1
prince	1
vasli	1
recovering	1
themselves	1
followed	1
her	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
eldest	1
sister	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
hard	1
face	1
again	1
biting	1
her	1
underlip	1
at	1
sight	1
of	1

her	1
expression	1
showed	1
an	1
irrepressible	1
hatred	1
yes	1
now	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
glad	1
said	1
she	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
waiting	1
for	1
and	1
bursting	1
into	1
tears	1
she	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
rushed	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
prince	1
vasli	1
came	1
next	1
he	1
staggered	1
to	1
the	1
sofa	1
on	1
which	1
pierre	1
was	1
sitting	1
and	1
dropped	1
onto	1
it	1
covering	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
jaw	1
quivered	1
and	1
shook	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
an	1
ague	1
ah	1
my	1
friend	1
said	1
he	1
taking	1
pierre	1
by	1
the	1
elbow	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
a	1
sincerity	1
and	1
weakness	1
pierre	1
had	1
never	1
observed	1
in	1
it	1
before	1
how	1
often	1
we	1
sin	1
how	1
much	1
we	1
deceive	1

all	1
for	1

i	1
too	1
all	1
will	1
end	1
in	1
death	1
all	1
death	1
is	1
awful	1
and	1
he	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
came	1
out	1
last	1
she	1
approached	1
pierre	1
with	1
slow	1
quiet	1
steps	1
pierre	1
she	1
said	1
pierre	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
inquiring	1
look	1
she	1
kissed	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
wetting	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
tears	1
then	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
she	1
said	1

at	1
her	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1

to	1

nothing	1

such	1
relief	1
as	1

she	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
pierre	1
was	1
glad	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
left	1
him	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
returned	1
he	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
said	1
to	1

is	1
a	1
great	1
loss	1
for	1
us	1

enough	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
this	1

perhaps	1
later	1

you	1
my	1

that	1
if	1

in	1
the	1
morning	1
she	1
told	1
the	1
rostvs	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
the	1
details	1
of	1

the	1

had	1
died	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
herself	1
wish	1
to	1
die	1
that	1
his	1
end	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
touching	1
but	1
edifying	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
meeting	1
between	1
father	1
and	1
son	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
touching	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
without	1
tears	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
had	1
behaved	1
better	1
during	1
those	1
awful	1
momentsthe	1
father	1
who	1
so	1
remembered	1
everything	1
and	1
everybody	1
at	1
last	1
and	1
had	1
spoken	1
such	1
pathetic	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
son	1
or	1
pierre	1
whom	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
pitiful	1
to	1
see	1
so	1
stricken	1
was	1
he	1
with	1
grief	1
though	1
he	1
tried	1
hard	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
sadden	1
his	1
dying	1
father	1
it	1
is	1
painful	1
but	1
it	1
does	1
one	1
good	1
it	1
uplifts	1
the	1
soul	1
to	1
see	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
the	1

to	1
visit	1
him	1
and	1
waited	1
in	1
the	1
lofty	1
antechamber	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
architect	1
gardener	1
or	1
princess	1
mary	1
did	1
till	1
the	1
prince	1
appeared	1
punctually	1
to	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour	1
everyone	1
sitting	1
in	1
this	1
antechamber	1
experienced	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
of	1
respect	1
and	1
even	1
fear	1
when	1
the	1
enormously	1
high	1
study	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
showed	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
rather	1
small	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
powdered	1
wig	1
small	1
withered	1
hands	1
and	1
bushy	1
gray	1
eyebrows	1
which	1
when	1
he	1
frowned	1
sometimes	1
hid	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
his	1
shrewd	1
youthfully	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
couple	1
were	1
to	1
arrive	1
princess	1
mary	1
entered	1
the	1
antechamber	1
as	1
usual	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
for	1
the	1
morning	1
greeting	1
crossing	1
herself	1
with	1
trepidation	1
and	1
repeating	1
a	1
silent	1
prayer	1
every	1
morning	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
like	1
that	1
and	1
every	1
morning	1
prayed	1
that	1
the	1
daily	1
interview	1
might	1
pass	1
off	1
well	1
an	1
old	1
powdered	1
manservant	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
antechamber	1
rose	1
quietly	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
please	1
walk	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
came	1
the	1
regular	1
hum	1
of	1
a	1
lathe	1
the	1
princess	1
timidly	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
which	1
moved	1
noiselessly	1
and	1
easily	1
she	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
working	1
at	1
the	1
lathe	1
and	1
after	1
glancing	1
round	1
continued	1
his	1
work	1
the	1
enormous	1
study	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
things	1
evidently	1
in	1
constant	1
use	1
the	1
large	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
books	1
and	1
plans	1
the	1
tall	1
glassfronted	1
bookcases	1
with	1
keys	1
in	1
the	1
locks	1
the	1
high	1
desk	1
for	1
writing	1
while	1
standing	1
up	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
an	1
open	1
exercise	1
book	1
and	1
the	1
lathe	1
with	1
tools	1
laid	1
ready	1
to	1
hand	1
and	1
shavings	1
scattered	1
aroundall	1
indicated	1
continuous	1
varied	1
and	1
orderly	1
activity	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
foot	1
shod	1
in	1
a	1
tartar	1
boot	1
embroidered	1
with	1
silver	1
and	1
the	1
firm	1
pressure	1
of	1
the	1
lean	1
sinewy	1
hand	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
still	1
possessed	1
the	1
tenacious	1
endurance	1
and	1
vigor	1
of	1
hardy	1
old	1
age	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
turns	1
of	1
the	1
lathe	1
he	1
removed	1
his	1
foot	1
from	1
the	1
pedal	1
wiped	1
his	1
chisel	1
dropped	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
leather	1
pouch	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
lathe	1
and	1
approaching	1
the	1
table	1
summoned	1
his	1
daughter	1
he	1
never	1
gave	1
his	1
children	1
a	1
blessing	1
so	1
he	1
simply	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
bristly	1
cheek	1
as	1
yet	1
unshaven	1
and	1
regarding	1
her	1
tenderly	1
and	1
attentively	1
said	1
severely	1
quite	1
well	1
all	1
right	1
then	1
sit	1
down	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
containing	1
lessons	1
in	1
geometry	1
written	1
by	1
himself	1
and	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
chair	1
with	1
his	1
foot	1
for	1
tomorrow	1
said	1
he	1
quickly	1
finding	1
the	1
page	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
scratch	1
from	1
one	1
paragraph	1
to	1
another	1
with	1
his	1
hard	1
nail	1
the	1
princess	1

the	1
table	1

a	1
letter	1
addressed	1
in	1
a	1
womans	1
hand	1
from	1
a	1
bag	1
hanging	1
above	1
the	1
table	1
onto	1
which	1
he	1
threw	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
red	1
patches	1
showed	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
princess	1
face	1
she	1
took	1
it	1
quickly	1
and	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
over	1
it	1
from	1
hlose	1
asked	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
smile	1
that	1
showed	1
his	1
still	1
sound	1
yellowish	1
teeth	1
yes	1

the	1

with	1
a	1
timid	1
glance	1
and	1
a	1
timid	1
smile	1

the	1
princess	1
blushing	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
holding	1
out	1
the	1
letter	1
the	1
third	1
i	1
said	1
the	1
third	1
cried	1
the	1
prince	1
abruptly	1
pushing	1
the	1
letter	1
away	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
drew	1
toward	1
him	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
containing	1
geometrical	1
figures	1
well	1
madam	1
he	1
began	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
book	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
placing	1
an	1
arm	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
sat	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
surrounded	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
by	1
the	1
acrid	1
scent	1
of	1
old	1
age	1
and	1
tobacco	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
so	1
long	1
now	1
madam	1
these	1
triangles	1
are	1
equal	1
please	1
note	1
that	1
the	1
angle	1
abc	1
the	1
princess	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
scared	1
way	1
at	1
her	1
fathers	1
eyes	1
glittering	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
red	1
patches	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
came	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
nothing	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
frightened	1
that	1
her	1
fear	1
would	1
prevent	1
her	1
understanding	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
fathers	1
further	1
explanations	1
however	1
clear	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
teachers	1
fault	1
or	1
the	1
pupils	1
this	1
same	1
thing	1
happened	1
every	1
day	1
the	1
princess	1
eyes	1
grew	1
dim	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
anything	1
but	1
was	1
only	1
conscious	1
of	1
her	1
stern	1
fathers	1
withered	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
breath	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
could	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
quickly	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
problem	1
in	1
peace	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
beside	1
himself	1
moved	1
the	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
noisily	1
backward	1
and	1
forward	1
made	1
efforts	1
to	1
control	1
himself	1
and	1
not	1
become	1
vehement	1
but	1
almost	1
always	1
did	1
become	1
vehement	1
scolded	1
and	1
sometimes	1
flung	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
away	1

princess	1
gave	1
a	1
wrong	1
answer	1
well	1

a	1
fool	1
shouted	1
the	1
prince	1
pushing	1
the	1
book	1
aside	1
and	1
turning	1
sharply	1
away	1
but	1
rising	1
immediately	1
he	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
lightly	1
touched	1
his	1
daughters	1
hair	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
he	1
drew	1
up	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
explain	1

drive	1
all	1
the	1
nonsense	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
go	1
but	1
he	1
stopped	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
uncut	1
book	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
desk	1

sort	1
of	1

he	1
patted	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
himself	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
her	1
princess	1
mary	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
sad	1
scared	1
expression	1
that	1
rarely	1
left	1
her	1
and	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
plain	1
sickly	1
face	1
yet	1
plainer	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
writing	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
stood	1
miniature	1
portraits	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
littered	1
with	1
books	1
and	1
papers	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
as	1
untidy	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
tidy	1
she	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
geometry	1
book	1
and	1
eagerly	1
broke	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
her	1
letter	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
her	1
most	1
intimate	1
friend	1
from	1
childhood	1
that	1
same	1
julie	1
kargina	1
who	1

dear	1
and	1
precious	1
friend	1
how	1
terrible	1
and	1
frightful	1
a	1
thing	1
is	1
separation	1
though	1
i	1
tell	1
myself	1
that	1
half	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
half	1
my	1
happiness	1
are	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
you	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
distance	1
separating	1
us	1
our	1
hearts	1
are	1
united	1
by	1
indissoluble	1
bonds	1
my	1
heart	1
rebels	1
against	1
fate	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
pleasures	1
and	1
distractions	1
around	1
me	1
i	1
cannot	1
overcome	1
a	1
certain	1
secret	1
sorrow	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
ever	1
since	1
we	1
parted	1
why	1
are	1
we	1
not	1
together	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
last	1
summer	1
in	1
your	1
big	1
study	1
on	1
the	1
blue	1
sofa	1
the	1
confidential	1
sofa	1
why	1
cannot	1
i	1
now	1
as	1
three	1
months	1
ago	1
draw	1
fresh	1
moral	1
strength	1
from	1
your	1
look	1
so	1
gentle	1
calm	1
and	1
penetrating	1
a	1
look	1
i	1
loved	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
before	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
write	1
having	1
read	1
thus	1
far	1
princess	1
mary	1
sighed	1
and	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
mirror	1
which	1
stood	1
on	1
her	1
right	1
it	1
reflected	1
a	1
weak	1
ungraceful	1
figure	1
and	1
thin	1
face	1
her	1
eyes	1
always	1
sad	1
now	1
looked	1
with	1
particular	1
hopelessness	1
at	1
her	1
reflection	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
she	1
flatters	1
me	1
thought	1
the	1
princess	1
turning	1
away	1
and	1
continuing	1
to	1
read	1
but	1
julie	1
did	1
not	1
flatter	1
her	1
friend	1
the	1
princess	1
eyeslarge	1
deep	1
and	1
luminous	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
times	1
there	1
radiated	1
from	1
them	1
shafts	1
of	1
warm	1
lightwere	1
so	1
beautiful	1
that	1
very	1
often	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
plainness	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
they	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
attraction	1
more	1
powerful	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
beauty	1
but	1
the	1
princess	1
never	1
saw	1
the	1
beautiful	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
eyesthe	1
look	1
they	1
had	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
herself	1
as	1
with	1
everyone	1
her	1
face	1
assumed	1
a	1
forced	1
unnatural	1
expression	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
glass	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
reading	1
all	1
moscow	1

of	1
nothing	1

war	1
one	1
of	1

to	1
the	1

that	1
the	1
corsican	1
monster	1
who	1
is	1
destroying	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
europe	1
may	1
be	1
overthrown	1
by	1
the	1
angel	1
whom	1
it	1
has	1
pleased	1
the	1
almighty	1
in	1
his	1
goodness	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
as	1
sovereign	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
my	1
brothers	1
this	1
war	1
has	1
deprived	1
me	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
associations	1
nearest	1
my	1
heart	1
i	1
mean	1
young	1
nicholas	1
rostv	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
enthusiasm	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
remain	1
inactive	1
and	1
has	1
left	1
the	1
university	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army	1
i	1
will	1
confess	1
to	1
you	1
dear	1
mary	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
extreme	1
youth	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
grief	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
whom	1
i	1
spoke	1
to	1
you	1
last	1
summer	1
is	1
so	1
nobleminded	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
that	1
real	1
youthfulness	1
which	1
one	1
seldom	1
finds	1
nowadays	1
among	1
our	1
old	1
men	1
of	1
twenty	1
and	1
particularly	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
frank	1
and	1
has	1
so	1
much	1
heart	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
pure	1
and	1
poetic	1
that	1
my	1
relations	1
with	1
him	1
transient	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
have	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sweetest	1
comforts	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
heart	1
which	1
has	1
already	1
suffered	1
so	1
much	1
someday	1
i	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
our	1
parting	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
said	1
then	1
that	1
is	1
still	1
too	1
fresh	1
ah	1
dear	1
friend	1
you	1
are	1
happy	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
these	1
poignant	1
joys	1
and	1
sorrows	1
you	1
are	1
fortunate	1
for	1
the	1
latter	1
are	1
generally	1
the	1
stronger	1
i	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
count	1
nicholas	1
is	1
too	1
young	1
ever	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
a	1
friend	1
but	1
this	1
sweet	1
friendship	1
this	1
poetic	1
and	1
pure	1
intimacy	1
were	1
what	1
my	1
heart	1
needed	1
but	1
enough	1
of	1
this	1
the	1
chief	1
news	1
about	1
which	1
all	1
moscow	1
gossips	1
is	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
old	1
count	1
bezkhov	1
and	1
his	1
inheritance	1
fancy	1
the	1
three	1
princesses	1
have	1
received	1
very	1
little	1
prince	1
vasli	1
nothing	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
monsieur	1
pierre	1
who	1
has	1
inherited	1
all	1
the	1
property	1
and	1
has	1
besides	1
been	1
recognized	1
as	1
legitimate	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
count	1
bezkhov	1
and	1
possessor	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
fortune	1
in	1
russia	1
it	1
is	1
rumored	1
that	1
prince	1
vasli	1
played	1
a	1
very	1
despicable	1
part	1
in	1
this	1
affair	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
petersburg	1
quite	1
crestfallen	1
i	1
confess	1
i	1
understand	1
very	1
little	1
about	1
all	1
these	1
matters	1
of	1
wills	1
and	1
inheritance	1
but	1
i	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
whom	1
we	1
all	1
used	1
to	1
know	1
as	1
plain	1
monsieur	1
pierre	1
has	1
become	1
count	1
bezkhov	1
and	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
fortunes	1
in	1
russia	1
i	1
am	1
much	1
amused	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
and	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
mammas	1
burdened	1
by	1
marriageable	1
daughters	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
themselves	1
toward	1
him	1
though	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
me	1
he	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
poor	1
sort	1
of	1
fellow	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
past	1
two	1
years	1
people	1
have	1
amused	1
themselves	1
by	1
finding	1
husbands	1
for	1
me	1
most	1
of	1
whom	1
i	1
dont	1
even	1
know	1
the	1
matchmaking	1
chronicles	1
of	1
moscow	1
now	1
speak	1
of	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
future	1
countess	1
bezkhova	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
understand	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
desire	1
for	1
the	1
post	1
propos	1
of	1
marriages	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
while	1
ago	1
that	1
universal	1
auntie	1
anna	1
mikhylovna	1
told	1
me	1
under	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
strict	1
secrecy	1
of	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
marriage	1
for	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less	1
than	1
with	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
son	1
anatole	1
whom	1
they	1
wish	1
to	1
reform	1
by	1
marrying	1
him	1
to	1
someone	1
rich	1
and	1
distingue	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
you	1
that	1
his	1
relations	1
choice	1
has	1
fallen	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
i	1
consider	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
handsome	1
and	1
a	1
terrible	1
scapegrace	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
about	1
him	1
but	1
enough	1
of	1
gossip	1
i	1
am	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
second	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
and	1
mamma	1
has	1
sent	1
for	1
me	1
to	1

am	1
sending	1
you	1
it	1
has	1
an	1
enormous	1
success	1
here	1
though	1
there	1
are	1
things	1
in	1
it	1
difficult	1
for	1
the	1
feeble	1
human	1
mind	1
to	1
grasp	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
admirable	1
book	1
which	1
calms	1
and	1
elevates	1
the	1
soul	1
adieu	1
give	1
my	1
respects	1
to	1

my	1

i	1
embrace	1
you	1
as	1
i	1
love	1
you	1
julie	1
ps	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
news	1
of	1
your	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
charming	1
little	1
wife	1
the	1
princess	1
pondered	1
awhile	1
with	1
a	1
thoughtful	1
smile	1
and	1
her	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
entirely	1
transformed	1
then	1
she	1
suddenly	1
rose	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
heavy	1
tread	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
took	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
and	1
her	1
hand	1
moved	1
rapidly	1
over	1
it	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
reply	1
she	1
wrote	1
also	1
in	1
french	1
dear	1
and	1
precious	1
friend	1
your	1
letter	1
of	1
the	1
th	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
great	1
delight	1
so	1
you	1
still	1
love	1
me	1
my	1
romantic	1
julie	1
separation	1
of	1
which	1
you	1
say	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
is	1
bad	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
its	1
usual	1
effect	1
on	1
you	1
you	1
complain	1
of	1
our	1
separation	1
what	1
then	1
should	1
i	1
say	1
if	1
i	1
dared	1
complain	1
i	1
who	1
am	1
deprived	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
are	1
dear	1
to	1
me	1
ah	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
religion	1
to	1
console	1
us	1
life	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
sad	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
look	1
severely	1
on	1
your	1
affection	1
for	1
that	1
young	1
man	1
on	1
such	1
matters	1
i	1
am	1
only	1
severe	1
with	1
myself	1
i	1
understand	1
such	1
feelings	1
in	1
others	1
and	1
if	1
never	1
having	1
felt	1
them	1
i	1
cannot	1
approve	1
of	1
them	1
neither	1
do	1
i	1
condemn	1
them	1
only	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
christian	1
love	1
love	1
of	1
ones	1
neighbor	1
love	1
of	1
ones	1
enemy	1
is	1
worthier	1
sweeter	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
feelings	1
which	1
the	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
can	1
inspire	1
in	1
a	1
romantic	1
and	1
loving	1
young	1
girl	1
like	1
yourself	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
count	1
bezkhovs	1
death	1
reached	1
us	1
before	1
your	1
letter	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
much	1
affected	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
says	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
representative	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
century	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
own	1
turn	1
now	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
he	1
can	1
to	1
let	1
his	1
turn	1
come	1
as	1
late	1
as	1
possible	1
god	1
preserve	1
us	1
from	1
that	1
terrible	1
misfortune	1
i	1
cannot	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
about	1
pierre	1
whom	1
i	1
knew	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
he	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
excellent	1
heart	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
quality	1
i	1
value	1
most	1
in	1
people	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
inheritance	1
and	1
the	1
part	1
played	1
by	1
prince	1
vasli	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
sad	1
for	1
both	1
ah	1
my	1
dear	1
friend	1
our	1
divine	1
saviours	1
words	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
needle	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
god	1
are	1
terribly	1
true	1
i	1
pity	1
prince	1
vasli	1
but	1
am	1
still	1
more	1
sorry	1
for	1
pierre	1
so	1
young	1
and	1
burdened	1
with	1
such	1
richesto	1
what	1
temptations	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
exposed	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
asked	1
what	1
i	1
desire	1
most	1
on	1
earth	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
be	1
poorer	1
than	1
the	1
poorest	1
beggar	1
a	1
thousand	1
thanks	1
dear	1
friend	1
for	1
the	1
volume	1
you	1
have	1
sent	1
me	1
and	1
which	1
has	1
such	1
success	1
in	1
moscow	1
yet	1
since	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
among	1
some	1
good	1
things	1
it	1
contains	1
others	1
which	1
our	1
weak	1
human	1
understanding	1
cannot	1
grasp	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
rather	1
useless	1
to	1
spend	1
time	1
in	1
reading	1
what	1
is	1
unintelligible	1
and	1
can	1
therefore	1
bear	1
no	1
fruit	1
i	1
never	1
could	1
understand	1
the	1
fondness	1
some	1
people	1
have	1
for	1
confusing	1
their	1
minds	1
by	1
dwelling	1
on	1
mystical	1
books	1
that	1
merely	1
awaken	1
their	1
doubts	1
and	1
excite	1
their	1
imagination	1
giving	1
them	1
a	1
bent	1
for	1
exaggeration	1
quite	1
contrary	1
to	1
christian	1
simplicity	1
let	1
us	1
rather	1
read	1
the	1
epistles	1
and	1
gospels	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
seek	1
to	1
penetrate	1
what	1
mysteries	1
they	1
contain	1
for	1
how	1
can	1
we	1
miserable	1
sinners	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
know	1
the	1
terrible	1
and	1
holy	1
secrets	1
of	1
providence	1
while	1
we	1
remain	1
in	1
this	1
flesh	1
which	1
forms	1
an	1
impenetrable	1
veil	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
the	1
eternal	1
let	1
us	1
rather	1
confine	1
ourselves	1
to	1
studying	1
those	1
sublime	1
rules	1
which	1
our	1
divine	1
saviour	1
has	1
left	1
for	1
our	1
guidance	1
here	1
below	1
let	1
us	1
try	1
to	1
conform	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
follow	1
them	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
less	1
we	1
let	1
our	1
feeble	1
human	1
minds	1
roam	1
the	1
better	1
we	1
shall	1
please	1
god	1
who	1
rejects	1
all	1
knowledge	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
we	1
seek	1
to	1
fathom	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
conceal	1
from	1
us	1
the	1
sooner	1
will	1
he	1
vouchsafe	1
its	1
revelation	1
to	1
us	1
through	1
his	1
divine	1
spirit	1
my	1
father	1
has	1
not	1
spoken	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
a	1
suitor	1
but	1
has	1
only	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
and	1
is	1
expecting	1
a	1
visit	1
from	1
prince	1
vasli	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
project	1
of	1
marriage	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
dear	1
sweet	1
friend	1
that	1
i	1
look	1
on	1
marriage	1
as	1
a	1
divine	1
institution	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
must	1
conform	1
however	1
painful	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
should	1
the	1
almighty	1
lay	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
wife	1
and	1
mother	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
perform	1
them	1
as	1
faithfully	1
as	1
i	1
can	1
without	1
disquieting	1
myself	1
by	1
examining	1
my	1
feelings	1
toward	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
may	1
give	1
me	1
for	1
husband	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
my	1
brother	1
who	1
announces	1
his	1
speedy	1
arrival	1
at	1
bald	1
hills	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
this	1
pleasure	1
will	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
brief	1
one	1
however	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
us	1
again	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
this	1
unhappy	1
war	1
into	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
drawn	1
god	1
knows	1
how	1
or	1
why	1
not	1
only	1
where	1
you	1
areat	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
affairs	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
worldis	1
the	1
talk	1
all	1
of	1
war	1
even	1
here	1
amid	1
fieldwork	1
and	1
the	1
calm	1
of	1
naturewhich	1
townsfolk	1
consider	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
countryrumors	1
of	1
war	1
are	1
heard	1
and	1
painfully	1
felt	1
my	1
father	1
talks	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
marches	1
and	1
countermarches	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
understand	1
nothing	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
during	1
my	1
daily	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
village	1
i	1
witnessed	1
a	1
heartrending	1
scene	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
convoy	1
of	1
conscripts	1
enrolled	1
from	1
our	1
people	1
and	1
starting	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
mothers	1
wives	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
going	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
sobs	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
though	1
mankind	1
has	1
forgotten	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
its	1
divine	1
saviour	1
who	1
preached	1
love	1
and	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
injuriesand	1
that	1
men	1
attribute	1
the	1
greatest	1
merit	1
to	1
skill	1
in	1
killing	1
one	1
another	1
adieu	1
dear	1
and	1
kind	1
friend	1
may	1
our	1
divine	1
saviour	1
and	1
his	1
most	1
holy	1
mother	1
keep	1
you	1
in	1
their	1
holy	1
and	1
allpowerful	1
care	1
mary	1
ah	1
you	1
are	1
sending	1
off	1
a	1
letter	1
princess	1
i	1
have	1
already	1
dispatched	1
mine	1
i	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
mother	1
said	1
the	1
smiling	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
rapidly	1
in	1
her	1
pleasant	1
mellow	1
tones	1
and	1
with	1
guttural	1
rs	1
she	1
brought	1
into	1
princess	1
marys	1
strenuous	1
mournful	1
and	1
gloomy	1
world	1
a	1
quite	1
different	1
atmosphere	1
careless	1
lighthearted	1
and	1
selfsatisfied	1
princess	1
i	1
must	1
warn	1
you	1
she	1
added	1
lowering	1
her	1
voice	1
and	1
evidently	1
listening	1
to	1
herself	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
speaking	1
with	1
exaggerated	1
grasseyement	1
the	1
prince	1
has	1
been	1
scolding	1
michael	1
ivnovich	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
humor	1
very	1
morose	1
be	1
prepared	1
ah	1
dear	1
friend	1
replied	1
princess	1
mary	1
i	1
have	1
asked	1
you	1
never	1

of	1
the	1
humor	1

father	1

in	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
allow	1
myself	1
to	1
judge	1
him	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
others	1
do	1
so	1
the	1
princess	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
watch	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
five	1
minutes	1
late	1
in	1
starting	1
her	1
practice	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord	1
went	1
into	1
the	1

from	1
the	1

knew	1
this	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
tkhon	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
ascertain	1
whether	1
his	1
fathers	1

had	1
changed	1

at	1

the	1
little	1

during	1
this	1
time	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
short	1
downy	1
smiling	1
lip	1
lifted	1
when	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
just	1
as	1
merrily	1
and	1
prettily	1
as	1
ever	1
why	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
palace	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
looking	1
around	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
people	1
compliment	1

with	1

her	1
with	1
a	1
courteous	1

sad	1
expression	1

grown	1
older	1
tkhon	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
passing	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
kissed	1
his	1
hand	1
before	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
clavichord	1
came	1
the	1
pretty	1
fairhaired	1
frenchwoman	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
rushed	1
out	1
apparently	1
beside	1
herself	1
with	1
delight	1
ah	1
what	1
joy	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
exclaimed	1
she	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
must	1
let	1
her	1
know	1
no	1
no	1

not	1
you	1

said	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
kissing	1
her	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
already	1
through	1
my	1
sisterinlaws	1
friendship	1
for	1
you	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
expecting	1
us	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
oftrepeated	1
passage	1
of	1
the	1
sonata	1
prince	1
andrew	1
stopped	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
grimace	1
as	1
if	1
expecting	1
something	1
unpleasant	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
passage	1
broke	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
a	1
cry	1
was	1
heard	1
then	1
princess	1
marys	1
heavy	1
tread	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
kissing	1
when	1
prince	1
andrew	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
princesses	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
met	1
once	1
before	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
at	1
his	1
wedding	1
were	1
in	1
each	1
others	1
arms	1
warmly	1
pressing	1
their	1
lips	1
to	1
whatever	1
place	1
they	1
happened	1
to	1
touch	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
stood	1
near	1
them	1
pressing	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
heart	1
with	1
a	1
beatific	1
smile	1
and	1
obviously	1
equally	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
or	1
to	1
laugh	1
prince	1
andrew	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
frowned	1
as	1
lovers	1
of	1
music	1
do	1
when	1
they	1
hear	1
a	1
false	1
note	1
the	1
two	1
women	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
then	1
as	1
if	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
too	1
late	1
seized	1
each	1
others	1
hands	1
kissing	1
them	1
and	1
pulling	1
them	1
away	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
kissing	1
each	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
prince	1
andrews	1
surprise	1
both	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
and	1
kissed	1
again	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
also	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
prince	1
andrew	1
evidently	1
felt	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
women	1
it	1
seemed	1
quite	1
natural	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
cry	1
and	1
apparently	1
it	1
never	1
entered	1
their	1
heads	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
otherwise	1
at	1
this	1
meeting	1
ah	1
my	1
dear	1
ah	1
mary	1
they	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed	1
and	1
then	1
laughed	1
i	1
dreamed	1
last	1
nightyou	1
were	1
not	1
expecting	1
us	1
ah	1
mary	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
thinner	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
grown	1
stouter	1
i	1
knew	1
the	1
princess	1
at	1
once	1
put	1
in	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
exclaimed	1
princess	1
mary	1
ah	1
andrew	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
you	1
prince	1
andrew	1
and	1
his	1
sister	1
hand	1
in	1
hand	1
kissed	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
crybaby	1
as	1
ever	1
princess	1
mary	1
had	1
turned	1
toward	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
through	1
her	1
tears	1
the	1
loving	1
warm	1
gentle	1
look	1
of	1
her	1
large	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
very	1
beautiful	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
rested	1
on	1
prince	1
andrews	1
face	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
talked	1
incessantly	1
her	1
short	1
downy	1
upper	1
lip	1
continually	1
and	1
rapidly	1
touching	1
her	1
rosy	1
nether	1
lip	1
when	1
necessary	1
and	1
drawing	1
up	1
again	1
next	1
moment	1
when	1
her	1
face	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
glittering	1
teeth	1
and	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
she	1
told	1
of	1
an	1
accident	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
spsski	1
hill	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
serious	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
condition	1
and	1
immediately	1
after	1
that	1
informed	1
them	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
all	1
her	1
clothes	1
in	1
petersburg	1
and	1
that	1
heaven	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
dress	1
in	1
here	1
and	1
that	1
andrew	1
had	1
quite	1
changed	1
and	1
that	1
kitty	1
odntsova	1
had	1
married	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
suitor	1
for	1
mary	1
a	1
real	1
one	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
talk	1
of	1
that	1
later	1
princess	1
mary	1
was	1
still	1
looking	1
silently	1
at	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
sadness	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
following	1
a	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
independent	1
of	1
her	1
sisterinlaws	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
petersburg	1
fete	1
she	1
addressed	1
her	1
brother	1
so	1

andrew	1
she	1
said	1
sighing	1
lise	1
sighed	1
too	1
yes	1
and	1
even	1
tomorrow	1
replied	1
her	1
brother	1
he	1
is	1

here	1
god	1
knows	1
why	1
when	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
promotion	1
princess	1
mary	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
but	1
continuing	1
her	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
sisterinlaw	1
with	1
a	1
tender	1
glance	1
at	1
her	1
figure	1
is	1
it	1
certain	1
she	1
said	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
changed	1
she	1
sighed	1
and	1
said	1
yes	1
quite	1
certain	1
ah	1

is	1
very	1
dreadful	1
her	1
lip	1
descended	1
she	1
brought	1
her	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
sisterinlaws	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
she	1
needs	1
rest	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
with	1
a	1
frown	1
dont	1

be	1
answered	1
the	1
princess	1
joyfully	1
and	1

the	1
hours	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
the	1
walks	1
in	1
the	1
avenues	1
and	1
the	1
lathe	1
asked	1
prince	1
andrew	1
with	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
respect	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
weaknesses	1
the	1
hours	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
the	1
lathe	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
mathematics	1
and	1
my	1
geometry	1
lessons	1
said	1
princess	1
mary	1
gleefully	1
as	1
if	1
her	1
lessons	1
in	1
geometry	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
greatest	1
delights	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
when	1
the	1
twenty	1
minutes	1
had	1
elapsed	1

when	1

at	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour	1
the	1
prince	1
powdered	1
and	1

entered	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
where	1
his	1
daughterinlaw	1
princess	1
mary	1
and	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
were	1
already	1
awaiting	1
him	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
architect	1
who	1
by	1
a	1
strange	1
caprice	1
of	1
his	1
employers	1
was	1
admitted	1
to	1
table	1
though	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
that	1
insignificant	1
individual	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
could	1
certainly	1
not	1
have	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
honor	1
the	1
prince	1
who	1
generally	1
kept	1
very	1
strictly	1
to	1
social	1
distinctions	1
and	1
rarely	1
admitted	1
even	1
important	1
government	1
officials	1
to	1
his	1
table	1
had	1
unexpectedly	1
selected	1
michael	1
ivnovich	1
who	1
always	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
to	1
blow	1
his	1
nose	1
on	1
his	1
checked	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
illustrate	1
the	1
theory	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
are	1
equals	1
and	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
impressed	1
on	1
his	1
daughter	1
that	1
michael	1
ivnovich	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
worse	1
than	1
you	1
or	1
i	1
at	1
dinner	1
the	1
prince	1
usually	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
taciturn	1
michael	1
ivnovich	1
more	1
often	1
than	1
to	1
anyone	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
which	1
like	1

to	1
the	1

and	1
anxiously	1
glancing	1
from	1
the	1
clock	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
to	1
enter	1
prince	1
andrew	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
large	1
gilt	1
frame	1
new	1
to	1
him	1
containing	1
the	1
genealogical	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
bolknski	1
opposite	1
which	1
hung	1
another	1
such	1
frame	1
with	1
a	1
badly	1
painted	1
portrait	1
evidently	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
artist	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
estate	1
of	1
a	1
ruling	1
prince	1
in	1
a	1

alleged	1
descendant	1
of	1
rrik	1
and	1
ancestor	1
of	1
the	1
bolknskis	1
prince	1
andrew	1
looking	1
again	1
at	1
that	1
genealogical	1
tree	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
laughing	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
laughs	1
who	1
looks	1
at	1
a	1
portrait	1
so	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
amusing	1
how	1
thoroughly	1
like	1
him	1
that	1
is	1

said	1
to	1
princess	1
mary	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
princess	1
mary	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
brother	1
in	1
surprise	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
laughing	1
at	1
everything	1
her	1
father	1
did	1
inspired	1
her	1
with	1
reverence	1
and	1
was	1
beyond	1
question	1
everyone	1
has	1

continued	1

andrew	1

with	1
his	1
powerful	1
mind	1
indulging	1
in	1
such	1
nonsense	1
princess	1
mary	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
her	1
brothers	1
criticism	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
reply	1
when	1
the	1
expected	1
footsteps	1
were	1
heard	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
study	1
the	1
prince	1
walked	1
in	1
quickly	1
and	1
jauntily	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
wont	1
as	1
if	1
intentionally	1
contrasting	1
the	1
briskness	1
of	1
his	1
manners	1
with	1
the	1
strict	1
formality	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
great	1
clock	1
struck	1

with	1
a	1
shrill	1
tone	1
joined	1
in	1
from	1

the	1
prince	1
stood	1
still	1
his	1
lively	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
from	1
under	1
their	1
thick	1
bushy	1
eyebrows	1
sternly	1
scanned	1
all	1
present	1
and	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
she	1
felt	1
as	1
courtiers	1
do	1
when	1
the	1
tsar	1
enters	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
fear	1
and	1
respect	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
inspired	1
in	1
all	1
around	1
him	1
he	1
stroked	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
then	1
patted	1
her	1
awkwardly	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
her	1
neck	1
im	1

said	1
looking	1
attentively	1

he	1
laughed	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
dry	1
cold	1
unpleasant	1
way	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
only	1
and	1

not	1

did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
hear	1
his	1
words	1
she	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
seemed	1
confused	1
the	1
prince	1
asked	1
her	1
about	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
smile	1
and	1
talk	1
he	1
asked	1
about	1
mutual	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
still	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
chattered	1
away	1
giving	1

from	1

said	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
lively	1
as	1
she	1
became	1
animated	1
the	1
prince	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
sternly	1
and	1
suddenly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
studied	1
her	1
sufficiently	1
and	1
had	1
formed	1
a	1
definite	1
idea	1
of	1

a	1

of	1

prince	1
andrew	1
he	1
always	1
spoke	1
thus	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
has	1
been	1
telling	1
me	1
what	1
forces	1
are	1
being	1
collected	1
against	1
him	1
while	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
never	1
thought	1
much	1
of	1
him	1
michael	1
ivnovich	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
know	1
when	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
said	1
such	1
things	1
about	1
bonaparte	1
but	1
understanding	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
wanted	1
as	1
a	1
peg	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
hang	1
the	1
princes	1
favorite	1
topic	1
he	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
prince	1
wondering	1
what	1
would	1
follow	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
tactician	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
architect	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
again	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
war	1
on	1
bonaparte	1
and	1
the	1
generals	1
and	1
statesmen	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
seemed	1
convinced	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
mere	1
babies	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
a	1
b	1
c	1
of	1
war	1
or	1
of	1
politics	1
and	1
that	1
bonaparte	1
was	1
an	1
insignificant	1
little	1
frenchy	1
successful	1
only	1
because	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
potmkins	1
or	1
suvrovs	1
left	1
to	1
oppose	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
convinced	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
political	1
difficulties	1
in	1
europe	1
and	1
no	1
real	1
war	1
but	1
only	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
puppet	1
show	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
playing	1
pretending	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
real	1
prince	1
andrew	1
gaily	1
bore	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
ridicule	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
men	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
on	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
evident	1
pleasure	1
the	1
past	1
always	1
seems	1
good	1
said	1
he	1
but	1
did	1
not	1

fall	1

told	1
you	1

the	1

the	1

in	1

his	1

no	1

it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1

he	1
was	1
as	1
little	1
able	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
opinion	1
he	1
listened	1
refraining	1
from	1
a	1

and	1
involuntarily	1
wondered	1
how	1
this	1
old	1
man	1
living	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
could	1

im	1
an	1
old	1

dont	1
understand	1
the	1
present	1

of	1

concluded	1

it	1
troubles	1

now	1
where	1
has	1
this	1

of	1

shown	1
his	1
skill	1
he	1
concluded	1
that	1
would	1
take	1
too	1
long	1
to	1

then	1
go	1

the	1

out	1
of	1

and	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
still	1
more	1
so	1
he	1
quitted	1
the	1
table	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
discussion	1
and	1
the	1

after	1
inspecting	1
the	1

those	1

in	1

carefully	1
tied	1

prince	1

face	1
looked	1
very	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
tender	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
behind	1
him	1
he	1
paced	1
briskly	1
from	1
corner	1
to	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
thoughtfully	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
did	1
he	1
fear	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war	1
or	1
was	1
he	1
sad	1
at	1
leaving	1
his	1
wifeperhaps	1
both	1
but	1
evidently	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
that	1
mood	1
for	1
hearing	1
footsteps	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
he	1
hurriedly	1
unclasped	1
his	1
hands	1
stopped	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
as	1
if	1
tying	1
the	1
cover	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
box	1
and	1
assumed	1
his	1
usual	1
tranquil	1
and	1
impenetrable	1
expression	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
heavy	1
tread	1
of	1
princess	1
mary	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
i	1
hear	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
orders	1
to	1
harness	1
she	1
cried	1
panting	1
she	1
had	1
apparently	1
been	1
running	1
and	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
wish	1
to	1
have	1
another	1
talk	1
with	1
you	1
alone	1
god	1
knows	1
how	1
long	1
we	1
may	1
again	1
be	1
parted	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
coming	1
you	1
have	1
changed	1
so	1
andrsha	1
she	1
added	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
explain	1
such	1
a	1
question	1
she	1
smiled	1
as	1
she	1
uttered	1
his	1
pet	1
name	1
andrsha	1
it	1
was	1
obviously	1
strange	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
stern	1
handsome	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
andrshathe	1
slender	1
mischievous	1
boy	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
playfellow	1
in	1
childhood	1
and	1
where	1
is	1
lise	1
he	1
asked	1
answering	1
her	1
question	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
smile	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
my	1
room	1
oh	1
andrew	1
what	1
a	1
treasure	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
you	1
have	1
said	1
she	1
sitting	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
facing	1
her	1
brother	1
she	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
child	1
such	1
a	1
dear	1
merry	1
child	1
i	1
have	1
grown	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
her	1
prince	1
andrew	1
was	1
silent	1
but	1
the	1
princess	1
noticed	1
the	1
ironical	1
and	1
contemptuous	1
look	1
that	1
showed	1
itself	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
one	1
must	1
be	1
indulgent	1
to	1
little	1
weaknesses	1
who	1
is	1
free	1
from	1
them	1
andrew	1
dont	1
forget	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
grown	1
up	1
and	1
been	1
educated	1
in	1
society	1
and	1
so	1
her	1
position	1
now	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
rosy	1
one	1
we	1
should	1
enter	1
into	1
everyones	1
situation	1
tout	1
comprendre	1
cest	1
tout	1
pardonner	1
think	1
what	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
for	1
her	1
poor	1
thing	1
after	1
what	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
to	1
be	1
parted	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
her	1
condition	1
its	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
understand	1
all	1
is	1
to	1
forgive	1
all	1
prince	1
andrew	1
smiled	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
sister	1
as	1
we	1
smile	1
at	1
those	1
we	1
think	1

andrew	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
princess	1
mary	1
was	1
first	1
surprised	1
and	1
then	1
aghast	1
at	1
this	1
question	1
for	1
me	1
for	1
me	1
trying	1
for	1
me	1
said	1
she	1
he	1
always	1
was	1
rather	1
harsh	1
and	1
now	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
hes	1
getting	1
very	1
trying	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
apparently	1
speaking	1
lightly	1
of	1
their	1
father	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
puzzle	1
or	1
test	1
his	1
sister	1
you	1
are	1
good	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
andrew	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
intellectual	1
pride	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
following	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
thoughts	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
trend	1
of	1
the	1
conversationand	1
thats	1
a	1
great	1
sin	1
how	1
can	1
one	1
judge	1
father	1
but	1
even	1
if	1
one	1
might	1
what	1
feeling	1
except	1
veneration	1
could	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
evoke	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
contented	1
and	1
happy	1
with	1
him	1
i	1
only	1
wish	1
you	1
were	1
all	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
her	1
brother	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
incredulously	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth	1
andrew	1
is	1
fathers	1
way	1
of	1
treating	1
religious	1
subjects	1
i	1
dont	1
understand	1
how	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
immense	1
intellect	1
can	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
day	1
and	1
can	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
astray	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
makes	1
me	1
unhappy	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
lately	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
improvement	1
his	1
satire	1
has	1
been	1
less	1
bitter	1
of	1
late	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
monk	1
he	1
received	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
talk	1
with	1
ah	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
monk	1
are	1
wasting	1
your	1
powder	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
banteringly	1
yet	1
tenderly	1
ah	1
mon	1
ami	1
i	1
only	1
pray	1
and	1
hope	1
that	1
god	1
will	1
hear	1
me	1
andrew	1
she	1
said	1
timidly	1
after	1
a	1
moments	1
silence	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
favor	1
to	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
dear	1
nopromise	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
refuse	1
it	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
trouble	1
and	1
is	1
nothing	1
unworthy	1
of	1
you	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
comfort	1
me	1
promise	1
andrsha	1
said	1
she	1
putting	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
her	1
reticule	1
but	1
not	1
yet	1
taking	1
out	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
inside	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
what	1
she	1
held	1
were	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
her	1
request	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
shown	1
before	1
the	1
request	1
was	1
granted	1
she	1
looked	1
timidly	1
at	1
her	1
brother	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
trouble	1
answered	1
prince	1
andrew	1
as	1
if	1
guessing	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
think	1
what	1
you	1
please	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
just	1
like	1

our	1
grandfather	1
wore	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
his	1

she	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
out	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
in	1
her	1
reticule	1
so	1
you	1
promise	1
of	1
course	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
andrew	1
i	1
bless	1
you	1
with	1
this	1
icon	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
promise	1
me	1

will	1
never	1
take	1
it	1
off	1

not	1
weigh	1
a	1
hundredweight	1
and	1
wont	1
break	1
my	1
neck	1
to	1
please	1
you	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
but	1
immediately	1
noticing	1
the	1
pained	1
expression	1
his	1
joke	1
had	1
brought	1
to	1
his	1
sisters	1
face	1
he	1
repented	1
and	1
added	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
really	1
dear	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
against	1
your	1

she	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
trembling	1
with	1
emotion	1
solemnly	1
holding	1
up	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
before	1
her	1

a	1

eyes	1
those	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
her	1

face	1
and	1
made	1

stopped	1

there	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
tenderness	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
touched	1
but	1
also	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
irony	1
on	1

face	1

him	1
on	1

kissed	1
her	1

his	1
fine	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
thoughtful	1
kindly	1
and	1
unaccustomed	1
brightness	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
not	1
at	1
his	1

over	1

head	1
toward	1
the	1

the	1
door	1
then	1
stopped	1
and	1
said	1
andrew	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
faith	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
turned	1
to	1
god	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
love	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
feel	1
and	1
your	1
prayer	1

said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
go	1
msha	1
ill	1
come	1
immediately	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
sisters	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
which	1
connected	1
one	1
wing	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
prince	1
andrew	1
met	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
smiling	1
sweetly	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
with	1
an	1
ecstatic	1
and	1
artless	1
smile	1
she	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
secluded	1
passages	1
oh	1
i	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
your	1
room	1
she	1
said	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
blushing	1
and	1
dropping	1
her	1
eyes	1
prince	1
andrew	1
looked	1
sternly	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
anger	1
suddenly	1
came	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
forehead	1
and	1
hair	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
eyes	1
with	1
such	1
contempt	1
that	1
the	1
frenchwoman	1
blushed	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
his	1
sisters	1
room	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
already	1
awake	1
and	1
her	1
merry	1
voice	1
hurrying	1
one	1
word	1
after	1
another	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
she	1
was	1
speaking	1
as	1
usual	1
in	1
french	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
after	1
long	1
selfrestraint	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
lost	1
time	1
no	1
but	1
imagine	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
zbova	1
with	1
false	1
curls	1
and	1
her	1
mouth	1
full	1
of	1
false	1
teeth	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
cheat	1
old	1
age	1
ha	1
ha	1
ha	1
mary	1
this	1
very	1
sentence	1
about	1
countess	1
zbova	1
and	1
this	1
same	1
laugh	1
prince	1
andrew	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
others	1
some	1
five	1
times	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
softly	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
plump	1
and	1
rosy	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
with	1
her	1
work	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
talking	1
incessantly	1
repeating	1
petersburg	1
reminiscences	1
and	1
even	1
phrases	1
prince	1
andrew	1
came	1
up	1
stroked	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
rested	1
after	1
their	1
journey	1
she	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
continued	1
her	1
chatter	1
the	1

waiting	1
at	1

with	1
keen	1

frigid	1

laughed	1
they	1
stood	1
silent	1
facing	1
one	1

the	1
old	1

sharp	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
straight	1
on	1

suddenly	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
angry	1
voice	1
opening	1
his	1
door	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
what	1
asked	1

for	1
a	1
moment	1
at	1

the	1

sighed	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
well	1
he	1
said	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
this	1
well	1
sounded	1
coldly	1
ironic	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
saying	1
now	1
go	1
through	1
your	1
performance	1
andrew	1
already	1
said	1
the	1
little	1

turning	1
pale	1
and	1
looking	1
with	1
dismay	1
at	1
her	1

he	1
embraced	1
her	1
she	1
screamed	1
and	1
fell	1
unconscious	1
on	1

he	1
cautiously	1
released	1
the	1

she	1
leaned	1
on	1

gently	1
to	1
his	1

taking	1
her	1
by	1

and	1
then	1
he	1
left	1
the	1

with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
the	1

with	1

full	1
of	1

at	1
the	1

through	1
which	1
prince	1

made	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

in	1
his	1
direction	1
from	1
the	1
study	1
like	1
pistol	1

came	1
the	1
frequent	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1

man	1
angrily	1
blowing	1
his	1

hardly	1
had	1

from	1

to	1
be	1

by	1

that	1

with	1
curiosity	1
at	1

on	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1

an	1
order	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1

would	1
inspect	1
the	1

on	1

the	1

of	1
the	1
order	1
were	1
not	1
clear	1
to	1
the	1

the	1
question	1
arose	1
whether	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
marching	1
order	1
or	1
not	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
at	1
a	1
consultation	1
between	1
the	1
battalion	1
commanders	1
to	1
present	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
parade	1
order	1
on	1
the	1
principle	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
better	1
to	1
bow	1
too	1
low	1
than	1
not	1
bow	1
low	1
enough	1
so	1
the	1

after	1
a	1
twentymile	1
march	1
were	1
kept	1
mending	1
and	1
cleaning	1
all	1
night	1
long	1
without	1
closing	1
their	1
eyes	1
while	1
the	1
adjutants	1

company	1
commanders	1
calculated	1
and	1
reckoned	1

by	1

the	1

of	1
the	1
straggling	1

crowd	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
its	1
last	1
march	1
the	1
day	1
beforepresented	1
a	1
wellordered	1
array	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
men	1
each	1
of	1
whom	1
knew	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
his	1
duty	1
had	1
every	1
button	1
and	1
every	1
strap	1
in	1
place	1
and	1
shone	1
with	1
cleanliness	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
externally	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
order	1
but	1
had	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
to	1
look	1
under	1
the	1
uniforms	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
on	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
clean	1
shirt	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
knapsack	1
the	1
appointed	1
number	1
of	1
articles	1

and	1
all	1
as	1
the	1
soldiers	1
say	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
circumstance	1
concerning	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
be	1
at	1
ease	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
boots	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
the	1
mens	1
boots	1
were	1
in	1
holes	1
but	1
this	1
defect	1
was	1
not	1
due	1
to	1
any	1
fault	1
of	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
for	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
repeated	1
demands	1
boots	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
issued	1
by	1
the	1
austrian	1
commissariat	1
and	1
the	1
regiment	1
had	1
marched	1
some	1
seven	1
hundred	1
miles	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
was	1
an	1
elderly	1
choleric	1
stout	1
and	1
thickset	1
general	1
with	1
grizzled	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
whiskers	1
and	1
wider	1
from	1
chest	1
to	1
back	1
than	1
across	1
the	1
shoulders	1
he	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
brandnew	1
uniform	1
showing	1
the	1
creases	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
folded	1
and	1
thick	1
gold	1
epaulettes	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
stand	1
rather	1
than	1
lie	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
massive	1
shoulders	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
happily	1
performing	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
solemn	1
duties	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
walked	1
about	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
pulled	1
himself	1
up	1
slightly	1
arching	1
his	1
back	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
admired	1
his	1
regiment	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
mind	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
it	1
yet	1
his	1
strut	1
seemed	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
besides	1
military	1
matters	1
social	1
interests	1
and	1
the	1
fair	1
sex	1
occupied	1

addressing	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
battalion	1
commanders	1
who	1
smilingly	1
pressed	1
forward	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
they	1
both	1
felt	1
happy	1
we	1
had	1
our	1
hands	1
full	1
last	1
night	1
however	1
i	1
think	1
the	1
regiment	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
one	1
eh	1
the	1

perceived	1
the	1
jovial	1
irony	1
and	1
laughed	1

would	1
not	1

even	1
on	1
the	1

what	1
asked	1
the	1
commander	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
the	1
town	1
on	1
which	1

had	1
been	1

were	1
an	1

followed	1
by	1
a	1
cossack	1
the	1
aidedecamp	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
order	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
clearly	1
worded	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
namely	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
regiment	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
march	1
in	1
their	1
greatcoats	1
and	1
packs	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
preparation	1
whatever	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
hofkriegsrath	1
from	1
vienna	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
kutzov	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
with	1
proposals	1
and	1
demands	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
join	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
archduke	1
ferdinand	1
and	1

among	1
other	1
arguments	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
view	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
austrian	1
general	1
the	1
wretched	1
state	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
troops	1
arrived	1
from	1
russia	1
with	1
this	1
object	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
regiment	1
so	1
the	1
worse	1
the	1
condition	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
better	1
pleased	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
would	1
be	1
though	1
the	1
aidedecamp	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
these	1
circumstances	1
he	1
nevertheless	1
delivered	1
the	1
definite	1
order	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
greatcoats	1
and	1
in	1
marching	1
order	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
would	1
otherwise	1
be	1
dissatisfied	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
hung	1
his	1
head	1
silently	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
arms	1
with	1
a	1
choleric	1
gesture	1
a	1
fine	1
mess	1
weve	1
made	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
remarked	1
there	1
now	1
didnt	1
i	1
tell	1

that	1
if	1
it	1
was	1

reproachfully	1

that	1

up	1

then	1
been	1
in	1
regular	1
order	1
and	1
silent	1

to	1
sway	1

hum	1
with	1
voices	1
on	1
all	1

soldiers	1
were	1

all	1

the	1

gray	1

the	1

walked	1
with	1
his	1
jerky	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1

down	1
the	1

was	1
evidently	1

at	1
his	1
own	1
display	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
walking	1
up	1
to	1
the	1

wished	1
to	1

for	1
wrath	1

at	1

to	1
his	1

with	1
a	1

countenance	1
opening	1
his	1
mouth	1
awry	1
prepared	1
to	1

the	1

fluttered	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
preening	1
its	1
plumage	1
and	1
became	1
motionless	1
attention	1
shouted	1
the	1
regimental	1

in	1
a	1
soulshaking	1
voice	1
which	1
expressed	1
joy	1
for	1
himself	1
severity	1
for	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
welcome	1
for	1
the	1
approaching	1
chief	1
along	1
the	1
broad	1
country	1
road	1
edged	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
by	1
trees	1
came	1
a	1
high	1
light	1
blue	1
viennese	1
calche	1
slightly	1
creaking	1
on	1
its	1
springs	1
and	1
drawn	1
by	1
six	1
horses	1
at	1
a	1
smart	1
trot	1
behind	1
the	1
calche	1
galloped	1
the	1
suite	1
and	1
a	1
convoy	1
of	1
croats	1
beside	1
kutzov	1
sat	1
an	1
austrian	1
general	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
uniform	1
that	1
looked	1
strange	1
among	1
the	1
russian	1
black	1
ones	1
the	1
calche	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
kutzov	1
and	1
the	1
austrian	1
general	1
were	1
talking	1
in	1
low	1
voices	1
and	1
kutzov	1
smiled	1
slightly	1
as	1
treading	1
heavily	1
he	1
stepped	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
those	1
two	1
thousand	1
men	1
breathlessly	1
gazing	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
did	1
not	1
exist	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
rang	1
out	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
regiment	1
quivered	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
jingling	1
sound	1
it	1
presented	1
arms	1
then	1
amidst	1
a	1
dead	1
silence	1
the	1
feeble	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
was	1
heard	1
the	1
regiment	1
roared	1
health	1
to	1
your	1
ex	1
len	1
len	1
lency	1
and	1
again	1
all	1
became	1
silent	1
at	1
first	1
kutzov	1
stood	1
still	1
while	1
the	1
regiment	1
moved	1
then	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
in	1
white	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
suite	1
walked	1
between	1
the	1
ranks	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
saluted	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
and	1
devoured	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
drawing	1
himself	1
up	1
obsequiously	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
ranks	1
behind	1
the	1
generals	1
bending	1
forward	1
and	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
jerky	1
movements	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
darted	1
forward	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
or	1
gesture	1
of	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
performed	1
his	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
subordinate	1
with	1
even	1
greater	1
zeal	1
than	1
his	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
commander	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
strictness	1
and	1
assiduity	1
of	1
its	1
commander	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
others	1
that	1
had	1
reached	1
braunau	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
was	1
in	1
splendid	1
condition	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
sick	1
and	1
stragglers	1
everything	1
was	1
in	1
good	1
order	1
except	1
the	1
boots	1
kutzov	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
ranks	1
sometimes	1
stopping	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
friendly	1
words	1
to	1
officers	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
turkish	1
war	1
sometimes	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
looking	1
at	1
their	1
boots	1
he	1
several	1
times	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
sadly	1
pointing	1
them	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
austrian	1
general	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
blaming	1
anyone	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
noticing	1
what	1
a	1
bad	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
ran	1
forward	1
on	1
each	1
such	1
occasion	1
fearing	1
to	1
miss	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chiefs	1
regarding	1
the	1
regiment	1
behind	1
kutzov	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
that	1
allowed	1
every	1
softly	1
spoken	1
word	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
followed	1
some	1
twenty	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
suite	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
talked	1
among	1
themselves	1
and	1
sometimes	1
laughed	1
nearest	1

a	1
handsome	1
adjutant	1

beside	1
him	1
was	1
his	1
comrade	1
nesvtski	1
a	1
tall	1
staff	1
officer	1
extremely	1
stout	1
with	1
a	1
kindly	1
smiling	1
handsome	1
face	1
and	1
moist	1
eyes	1
nesvtski	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
from	1
laughter	1
provoked	1
by	1
a	1
swarthy	1
hussar	1
officer	1
who	1
walked	1
beside	1
him	1
this	1
hussar	1
with	1
a	1
grave	1
face	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
smile	1
or	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
watched	1
the	1
regimental	1
commanders	1
back	1
and	1
mimicked	1
his	1
every	1
movement	1
each	1
time	1
the	1
commander	1
started	1
and	1
bent	1
forward	1
the	1
hussar	1
started	1
and	1
bent	1
forward	1
in	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
nesvtski	1
laughed	1
and	1
nudged	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
wag	1
kutzov	1
walked	1
slowly	1
and	1
languidly	1
past	1
thousands	1
of	1
eyes	1
which	1
were	1
starting	1
from	1
their	1
sockets	1
to	1
watch	1
their	1
chief	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
he	1
suddenly	1
stopped	1
his	1
suite	1
not	1
having	1
expected	1
this	1
involuntarily	1
came	1
closer	1
to	1
him	1
ah	1
timkhin	1
said	1
he	1
recognizing	1
the	1
rednosed	1
captain	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
reprimanded	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
blue	1
greatcoat	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
stretch	1
himself	1
more	1
than	1
timkhin	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
reprimanded	1
by	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
addressed	1
him	1
he	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
extent	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
sustained	1
it	1
had	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
kutzov	1
who	1
evidently	1
understood	1
his	1
case	1
and	1
wished	1
him	1
nothing	1
but	1
good	1
quickly	1
turned	1
away	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
flitting	1
over	1
his	1
scarred	1
and	1
puffy	1
face	1
another	1
ismail	1
comrade	1
said	1
he	1
a	1
brave	1
officer	1
are	1
you	1
satisfied	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
and	1
the	1
latterunconscious	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
reflected	1
in	1
the	1
hussar	1
officer	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
looking	1
glassstarted	1
moved	1
forward	1
and	1
answered	1
highly	1
satisfied	1
your	1
excellency	1
we	1
all	1
have	1
our	1
weaknesses	1
said	1
kutzov	1
smiling	1
and	1
walking	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
predilection	1
for	1
bacchus	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
was	1
afraid	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
blamed	1
for	1
this	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
the	1
hussar	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
noticed	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
rednosed	1
captain	1
and	1
his	1
drawnin	1
stomach	1
and	1
mimicked	1
his	1
expression	1
and	1
pose	1
with	1
such	1
exactitude	1
that	1
nesvtski	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing	1
kutzov	1
turned	1
round	1
the	1
officer	1
evidently	1
had	1
complete	1
control	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
while	1
kutzov	1
was	1
turning	1
managed	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
grimace	1
and	1
then	1
assume	1
a	1
most	1
serious	1
deferential	1
and	1
innocent	1
expression	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
kutzov	1
pondered	1
apparently	1
trying	1
to	1
recollect	1
something	1
prince	1
andrew	1
stepped	1
forward	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
suite	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
french	1
you	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
remind	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
officer	1
dlokhov	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
in	1
this	1
regiment	1
where	1
is	1
dlokhov	1
asked	1
kutzov	1
dlokhov	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
soldiers	1
gray	1
greatcoat	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
shapely	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
fairhaired	1
soldier	1
with	1
his	1
clear	1
blue	1
eyes	1
stepped	1
forward	1
from	1
the	1
ranks	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
and	1
presented	1
arms	1
have	1
you	1
a	1
complaint	1
to	1
make	1
kutzov	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
frown	1
this	1
is	1
dlokhov	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
ah	1
said	1
kutzov	1
i	1
hope	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
lesson	1
to	1
you	1
do	1
your	1
duty	1
the	1
emperor	1
is	1
gracious	1
and	1
i	1
shant	1
forget	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
deserve	1
well	1
the	1
clear	1
blue	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
just	1
as	1
boldly	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
seeming	1
by	1
their	1
expression	1
to	1
tear	1
open	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
convention	1
that	1
separates	1
a	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
so	1
widely	1
from	1
a	1
private	1
one	1
thing	1
i	1
ask	1
of	1
your	1
excellency	1
dlokhov	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
firm	1
ringing	1
deliberate	1
voice	1
i	1
ask	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
my	1
fault	1
and	1
prove	1
my	1
devotion	1
to	1
his	1
majesty	1
the	1
emperor	1
and	1
to	1
russia	1
kutzov	1
turned	1
away	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
from	1
captain	1
timkhin	1
again	1
flitted	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
grimace	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
everything	1
dlokhov	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
everything	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
him	1
that	1

that	1

by	1

kutzov	1
having	1
jerked	1
out	1
these	1
last	1
words	1
as	1
soldiers	1
do	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1

having	1
satisfied	1
himself	1
that	1
all	1

lifting	1
some	1
invisible	1

precious	1
object	1
above	1
his	1

and	1
holding	1
it	1
there	1
for	1
some	1
seconds	1
suddenly	1
flung	1

down	1
and	1
began	1

and	1
the	1

in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
his	1

rushed	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
and	1
walking	1
backwards	1
before	1
the	1
company	1
jerked	1
his	1
shoulders	1

flourished	1
his	1
castanets	1
as	1
if	1
threatening	1
someone	1
the	1
soldiers	1
swinging	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
keeping	1
time	1
spontaneously	1
marched	1
with	1
long	1
steps	1
behind	1
the	1
company	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
wheels	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
springs	1
and	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
horses	1

were	1
heard	1
kutzov	1
and	1
his	1
suite	1
were	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
should	1
continue	1
to	1
march	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
suite	1
showed	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
singing	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
dancing	1
soldier	1
and	1
the	1
gay	1
and	1
smartly	1
marching	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
file	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
beside	1
which	1
the	1
carriage	1
passed	1
the	1
company	1
a	1
blueeyed	1
soldier	1
involuntarily	1
attracted	1
notice	1
it	1
was	1
dlokhov	1
marching	1
with	1
particular	1
grace	1
and	1
boldness	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
song	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
those	1
driving	1
past	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
pitied	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
marching	1
with	1
the	1
company	1
the	1
hussar	1
cornet	1
of	1
kutzovs	1
suite	1
who	1
had	1
mimicked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
fell	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
dlokhov	1
hussar	1
cornet	1
zherkv	1
had	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
in	1
petersburg	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
set	1
led	1
by	1
dlokhov	1
zherkv	1
had	1
met	1
dlokhov	1
abroad	1
as	1
a	1
private	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
fit	1
to	1
recognize	1
him	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
kutzov	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
ranker	1
he	1
addressed	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
cordiality	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
said	1
he	1
through	1
the	1
singing	1
making	1
his	1
horse	1
keep	1
pace	1
with	1
the	1
company	1
how	1
am	1
i	1
dlokhov	1
answered	1
coldly	1
i	1
am	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
lively	1
song	1
gave	1
a	1
special	1
flavor	1
to	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
gaiety	1
with	1
which	1
zherkv	1
spoke	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
intentional	1
coldness	1
of	1
dlokhovs	1
reply	1
and	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
officers	1
inquired	1
zherkv	1
all	1
right	1
they	1
are	1
good	1
fellows	1
and	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
wriggled	1
onto	1
the	1
staff	1
i	1
was	1
attached	1
im	1
on	1
duty	1
both	1
were	1
silent	1
she	1
let	1
the	1
hawk	1
fly	1
upward	1
from	1
her	1
wide	1
right	1
sleeve	1
went	1
the	1
song	1
arousing	1
an	1
involuntary	1
sensation	1
of	1
courage	1
and	1
cheerfulness	1
their	1
conversation	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
been	1
different	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
that	1
song	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
austrians	1
have	1
been	1
beaten	1
asked	1
dlokhov	1
the	1
devil	1
only	1
knows	1
they	1
say	1
so	1
im	1
glad	1
answered	1
dlokhov	1
briefly	1
and	1
clearly	1
as	1
the	1
song	1
demanded	1
i	1
say	1
come	1
round	1
some	1
evening	1
and	1
well	1

thats	1

were	1
again	1
silent	1
come	1
if	1
you	1

anything	1
one	1

at	1
least	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
on	1

a	1
long	1
long	1
way	1
to	1
my	1
native	1
land	1
zherkv	1
touched	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
the	1
spurs	1
it	1
pranced	1
excitedly	1
from	1
foot	1
to	1
foot	1
uncertain	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
start	1
then	1
settled	1
down	1
galloped	1
past	1
the	1
company	1
and	1
overtook	1
the	1
carriage	1
still	1
keeping	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
song	1
chapter	1
iii	1
on	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
review	1
kutzov	1
took	1
the	1
austrian	1
general	1
into	1
his	1
private	1
room	1
and	1
calling	1
his	1
adjutant	1
asked	1
for	1
some	1
papers	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
on	1
their	1
arrival	1
and	1
the	1
letters	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
archduke	1
ferdinand	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
advanced	1
army	1
prince	1
andrew	1
bolknski	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
required	1
papers	1
kutzov	1
and	1
the	1
austrian	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
hofkriegsrath	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
a	1
plan	1
was	1
spread	1
out	1
ah	1
said	1
kutzov	1
glancing	1
at	1
bolknski	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
this	1
exclamation	1
he	1
was	1
asking	1
the	1
adjutant	1
to	1
wait	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
conversation	1
in	1
french	1
all	1
i	1
can	1
say	1
general	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
elegance	1
of	1
expression	1
and	1
intonation	1
that	1
obliged	1
one	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
each	1
deliberately	1
spoken	1
word	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
kutzov	1
himself	1
listened	1
with	1
pleasure	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
voice	1
all	1
i	1
can	1
say	1
general	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
matter	1
depended	1
on	1
my	1
personal	1
wishes	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
majesty	1
the	1
emperor	1
francis	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
fulfilled	1
long	1
ago	1
i	1
should	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
joined	1
the	1
archduke	1
and	1
believe	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
honour	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
personally	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
supreme	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
informed	1
and	1
more	1
skillful	1
generalof	1
whom	1
austria	1
has	1
so	1
manyand	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
all	1
this	1
heavy	1
responsibility	1
but	1
circumstances	1
are	1
sometimes	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
us	1
general	1
and	1
kutzov	1
smiled	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
at	1
liberty	1
not	1
to	1
believe	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
dont	1
even	1
care	1
whether	1
you	1
do	1
or	1
not	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
grounds	1
for	1
telling	1
me	1
so	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
point	1
the	1
austrian	1
general	1
looked	1
dissatisfied	1
but	1
had	1
no	1
option	1
but	1
to	1
reply	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
querulous	1
and	1
angry	1
tone	1
that	1
contrasted	1
with	1
his	1
flattering	1
words	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
your	1
excellencys	1
participation	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
action	1
is	1
highly	1
valued	1
by	1
his	1
majesty	1
but	1
we	1
think	1
the	1
present	1
delay	1
is	1
depriving	1
the	1
splendid	1
russian	1
troops	1
and	1
their	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
laurels	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
win	1
in	1
their	1
battles	1
he	1
concluded	1
his	1
evidently	1
prearranged	1
sentence	1
kutzov	1
bowed	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
conviction	1
and	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
letter	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
highness	1
the	1
archduke	1
ferdinand	1
has	1
honored	1
me	1
i	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
austrian	1
troops	1
under	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
so	1
skillful	1
a	1
leader	1
as	1
general	1
mack	1
have	1
by	1
now	1
already	1
gained	1
a	1
decisive	1
victory	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
need	1
our	1
aid	1
said	1
kutzov	1
the	1
general	1
frowned	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
definite	1
news	1
of	1
an	1
austrian	1
defeat	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
circumstances	1
confirming	1
the	1
unfavorable	1
rumors	1
that	1
were	1
afloat	1
and	1
so	1
kutzovs	1
suggestion	1
of	1
an	1
austrian	1
victory	1
sounded	1
much	1
like	1
irony	1
but	1
kutzov	1
went	1
on	1
blandly	1
smiling	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
suppose	1
so	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
the	1
last	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
macks	1
army	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
victory	1
and	1
stated	1
strategically	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
very	1
favorable	1
give	1
me	1
that	1
letter	1
said	1
kutzov	1
turning	1
to	1
prince	1
andrew	1
please	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
itand	1
kutzov	1
with	1
an	1
ironical	1
smile	1
about	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
read	1
to	1
the	1
austrian	1
general	1
the	1
following	1
passage	1
in	1
german	1
from	1
the	1
archduke	1
ferdinands	1
letter	1
we	1
have	1
fully	1
concentrated	1
forces	1
of	1
nearly	1
seventy	1
thousand	1
men	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
defeat	1
the	1
enemy	1
should	1
he	1
cross	1
the	1
lech	1
also	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
masters	1
of	1
ulm	1
we	1
cannot	1
be	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
commanding	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
danube	1
so	1
that	1
should	1
the	1
enemy	1
not	1
cross	1
the	1
lech	1
we	1
can	1
cross	1
the	1
danube	1
throw	1
ourselves	1
on	1
his	1
line	1
of	1
communications	1
recross	1
the	1
river	1
lower	1
down	1
and	1
frustrate	1
his	1
intention	1
should	1
he	1
try	1
to	1
direct	1
his	1
whole	1
force	1
against	1
our	1
faithful	1
ally	1
we	1
shall	1
therefore	1
confidently	1
await	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
imperial	1
russian	1
army	1
will	1
be	1
fully	1
equipped	1
and	1
shall	1
then	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
it	1
easily	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
the	1
enemy	1
the	1
fate	1
he	1
deserves	1
kutzov	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
on	1
finishing	1
this	1
paragraph	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
hofkriegsrath	1
mildly	1
and	1
attentively	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
wise	1
maxim	1
your	1
excellency	1
advising	1
one	1
to	1
expect	1
the	1
worst	1
said	1
the	1
austrian	1
general	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
jests	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
business	1
he	1
involuntarily	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
aidedecamp	1
excuse	1
me	1
general	1
interrupted	1
kutzov	1
also	1
turning	1
to	1
prince	1
andrew	1
look	1
here	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
get	1
from	1
kozlvski	1
all	1
the	1
reports	1
from	1
our	1
scouts	1
here	1
are	1
two	1
letters	1
from	1
count	1
nostitz	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
highness	1
the	1
archduke	1
ferdinand	1
and	1
here	1
are	1
these	1
he	1
said	1
handing	1
him	1
several	1
papers	1
make	1
a	1
neat	1
memorandum	1
in	1
french	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
showing	1
all	1
the	1
news	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
austrian	1
army	1
and	1
then	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
excellency	1
prince	1
andrew	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
having	1
understood	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
not	1
only	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
but	1
also	1
what	1
kutzov	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
he	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
to	1
both	1
stepped	1
softly	1
over	1
the	1
carpet	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
waiting	1
room	1
though	1
not	1
much	1
time	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
prince	1
andrew	1
had	1
left	1
russia	1
he	1
had	1
changed	1
greatly	1
during	1
that	1
period	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
movements	1
in	1
his	1
walk	1
scarcely	1
a	1
trace	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
affected	1
languor	1
and	1
indolence	1
he	1
now	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
impression	1
he	1
makes	1
on	1
others	1
but	1
is	1
occupied	1
with	1
agreeable	1
and	1
interesting	1
work	1
his	1
face	1
expressed	1
more	1
satisfaction	1
with	1
himself	1
and	1
those	1
around	1
him	1
his	1
smile	1
and	1
glance	1
were	1
brighter	1
and	1
more	1
attractive	1
kutzov	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
overtaken	1
in	1
poland	1
had	1
received	1
him	1
very	1
kindly	1
promised	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
him	1
distinguished	1
him	1
above	1
the	1
other	1
adjutants	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
to	1

given	1
him	1
the	1
more	1
serious	1
commissions	1
from	1

fair	1
to	1
become	1
an	1
officer	1
distinguished	1
by	1
his	1
industry	1
firmness	1
and	1
expedition	1
i	1
consider	1
myself	1
fortunate	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
subordinate	1
by	1
me	1
on	1
kutzovs	1
staff	1
among	1
his	1
fellow	1
officers	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
generally	1
prince	1
andrew	1
had	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
in	1
petersburg	1
society	1
two	1
quite	1
opposite	1
reputations	1
some	1
a	1
minority	1
acknowledged	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
different	1
from	1
themselves	1
and	1
from	1
everyone	1
else	1
expected	1
great	1
things	1
of	1
him	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
admired	1
and	1
imitated	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
prince	1
andrew	1
was	1
natural	1
and	1
pleasant	1
others	1
the	1
majority	1
disliked	1
him	1
and	1
considered	1
him	1
conceited	1
cold	1
and	1
disagreeable	1
but	1
among	1
these	1
people	1
prince	1
andrew	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
stand	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
respected	1
and	1
even	1
feared	1
him	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1

room	1
into	1
the	1
waiting	1
room	1
with	1
the	1

up	1
to	1
his	1

kozlvski	1

was	1
sitting	1
at	1

ordered	1
to	1

explaining	1
why	1

and	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
prince	1
andrew	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
any	1
news	1
from	1
mack	1
no	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
true	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
beaten	1
news	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
probably	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
moving	1
toward	1
the	1
outer	1
door	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
a	1
tall	1
austrian	1
general	1
in	1
a	1
greatcoat	1
with	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
maria	1
theresa	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
bandage	1
round	1
his	1
head	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
just	1
arrived	1
entered	1
quickly	1
slamming	1
the	1
door	1
prince	1
andrew	1
stopped	1
short	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
kutzov	1
said	1
the	1
newly	1
arrived	1
general	1
speaking	1
quickly	1
with	1
a	1
harsh	1
german	1
accent	1
looking	1
to	1
both	1
sides	1
and	1
advancing	1
straight	1
toward	1
the	1
inner	1
door	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
is	1
engaged	1
said	1
kozlvski	1
going	1
hurriedly	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
unknown	1
general	1
and	1
blocking	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
whom	1
shall	1
i	1
announce	1
the	1
unknown	1
general	1
looked	1
disdainfully	1
down	1
at	1
kozlvski	1
who	1
was	1
rather	1
short	1
as	1
if	1
surprised	1
that	1
anyone	1
should	1
not	1
know	1
him	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
is	1
engaged	1
repeated	1
kozlvski	1
calmly	1
the	1
generals	1
face	1
clouded	1
his	1
lips	1
quivered	1
and	1
trembled	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
notebook	1
hurriedly	1
scribbled	1
something	1
in	1
pencil	1
tore	1
out	1
the	1
leaf	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
kozlvski	1
stepped	1
quickly	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
threw	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
chair	1
gazing	1
at	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
why	1
do	1
they	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
then	1
he	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
stretched	1
his	1
neck	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
immediately	1
with	1
affected	1
indifference	1
began	1
to	1
hum	1
to	1
himself	1
producing	1
a	1
queer	1
sound	1
which	1
immediately	1
broke	1
off	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
private	1
room	1
opened	1
and	1
kutzov	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
the	1
general	1
with	1
the	1
bandaged	1
head	1
bent	1
forward	1
as	1
though	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
some	1
danger	1
and	1
making	1
long	1
quick	1
strides	1
with	1
his	1
thin	1
legs	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
kutzov	1
vous	1
voyez	1
le	1
malheureux	1
mack	1
he	1
uttered	1
in	1
a	1
broken	1
voice	1
kutzovs	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
doorway	1
remained	1
perfectly	1
immobile	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
then	1
wrinkles	1
ran	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
like	1
a	1
wave	1
and	1
his	1
forehead	1
became	1
smooth	1
again	1
he	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
respectfully	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
silently	1
let	1
mack	1
enter	1
his	1
room	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
himself	1
behind	1
him	1
the	1
report	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
circulated	1
that	1
the	1
austrians	1
had	1
been	1
beaten	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
had	1
surrendered	1
at	1
ulm	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
correct	1
within	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
adjutants	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
in	1
various	1
directions	1
with	1
orders	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
russian	1
troops	1
who	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
inactive	1
would	1
also	1
soon	1
have	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
enemy	1
prince	1
andrew	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
staff	1
officers	1
whose	1
chief	1
interest	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
mack	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
disaster	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
half	1
the	1
campaign	1
was	1
lost	1
understood	1
all	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
armys	1
position	1
and	1
vividly	1
imagined	1
what	1
awaited	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
play	1
involuntarily	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
joyful	1
agitation	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
humiliation	1
of	1
arrogant	1
austria	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
weeks	1
time	1
he	1
might	1
perhaps	1
see	1
and	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
russian	1
encounter	1
with	1
the	1
french	1
since	1
suvrov	1
met	1
them	1
he	1
feared	1
that	1
bonapartes	1
genius	1
might	1
outweigh	1
all	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
troops	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
could	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
hero	1
being	1
disgraced	1
excited	1
and	1
irritated	1
by	1
these	1
thoughts	1
prince	1
andrew	1
went	1
toward	1
his	1
room	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
wrote	1
every	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
he	1
met	1
nesvtski	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
shared	1
a	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
wag	1
zherkv	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
usual	1
laughing	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
so	1
glum	1
asked	1
nesvtski	1
noticing	1
prince	1
andrews	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
theres	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
gay	1

smile	1
of	1
glee	1

unable	1
to	1
suppress	1
your	1

stepping	1

he	1
bowed	1
his	1

and	1
scraped	1
first	1
with	1
one	1
foot	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
awkwardly	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
at	1
a	1
dancing	1
lesson	1
the	1
member	1

looked	1
at	1

could	1
not	1

give	1

bolknski	1

him	1
away	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
look	1

turned	1
to	1

by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
mack	1
the	1

his	1
defeat	1

the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1

vent	1
in	1
anger	1

jest	1
if	1
you	1

will	1
teach	1

nesvtski	1

he	1

wishing	1

he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
order	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
densov	1
with	1
a	1
pipe	1
was	1
squatting	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
facing	1
the	1
quartermaster	1
who	1
was	1
reporting	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
seeing	1
rostv	1
densov	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
pointing	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
with	1
his	1
thumb	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
telynin	1
was	1
sitting	1
he	1
frowned	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
shudder	1
of	1
disgust	1
ugh	1
i	1
dont	1
like	1
that	1
fellow	1
he	1
said	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
quartermasters	1
presence	1
rostv	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
nor	1
do	1
i	1
but	1
whats	1
one	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
having	1
given	1
his	1
order	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
telynin	1
telynin	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
indolent	1
pose	1
in	1
which	1
rostv	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
rubbing	1
his	1
small	1
white	1
hands	1
well	1
there	1
certainly	1

disgusting	1
people	1
thought	1
rostv	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
have	1
you	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
horse	1

telynin	1
getting	1

looking	1
carelessly	1
about	1
him	1
i	1
have	1

only	1
came	1

telynin	1
they	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
stable	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
explained	1
how	1
to	1
rivet	1
the	1
hoof	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
quarters	1
when	1

went	1
back	1

a	1
bottle	1
of	1

sitting	1
there	1
scratching	1
with	1
his	1

on	1
a	1

looked	1
gloomily	1
in	1
rostvs	1

and	1
said	1

leaned	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
pen	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
evidently	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
say	1
quicker	1
in	1
words	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1

seemed	1
congested	1
somewhere	1
below	1

throat	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1

he	1
could	1

a	1
moment	1
and	1
evidently	1
understanding	1
what	1
rostv	1
hinted	1
at	1
seized	1
his	1

he	1
cried	1

with	1
as	1
much	1
anger	1
as	1
though	1
densov	1

and	1
rostv	1
without	1

home	1
took	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
there	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
inn	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
which	1
the	1
officers	1
frequented	1
rostv	1

up	1
to	1

of	1

of	1

he	1
said	1
smiling	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
yes	1
said	1
rostv	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
cost	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1

the	1
only	1
sounds	1
heard	1
were	1
the	1
clatter	1
of	1
knives	1
and	1
the	1
munching	1
of	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
when	1
telynin	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
lunch	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
a	1
double	1
purse	1
and	1
drawing	1
its	1
rings	1
aside	1
with	1
his	1
small	1
white	1
turnedup	1

drew	1
out	1
a	1

went	1
up	1
to	1
telynin	1

he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
almost	1
inaudible	1
voice	1
with	1
shifting	1
eyes	1
but	1
eyebrows	1
still	1
raised	1

looking	1
about	1

his	1
usual	1
way	1
and	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
to	1
grow	1
very	1
merry	1
if	1

get	1
to	1
vienna	1
ill	1
get	1
rid	1

he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
purse	1
rostv	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
it	1
telynin	1
took	1
the	1
purse	1
and	1
began	1
carelessly	1
slipping	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
pocket	1
of	1
his	1
riding	1
breeches	1
with	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
lifted	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
slightly	1
open	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say	1
yes	1
yes	1

one	1
elses	1
business	1
well	1
young	1
man	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
and	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
lifted	1
brows	1
he	1
glanced	1
into	1
rostvs	1
eyes	1
some	1
flash	1
as	1
of	1
an	1
electric	1
spark	1
shot	1
from	1
telynins	1
eyes	1
to	1
rostvs	1
and	1
back	1
and	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
come	1
here	1
said	1
rostv	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
telynins	1
arm	1
and	1
almost	1
dragging	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
that	1
money	1
is	1
densovs	1
you	1
took	1
it	1
he	1
whispered	1
just	1
above	1
telynins	1
ear	1
what	1
what	1
how	1
dare	1
you	1
what	1
said	1
telynin	1
but	1
these	1
words	1
came	1
like	1
a	1
piteous	1
despairing	1
cry	1
and	1
an	1
entreaty	1
for	1
pardon	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
rostv	1
heard	1
them	1
an	1
enormous	1
load	1
of	1
doubt	1
fell	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
began	1
to	1
pity	1
the	1
miserable	1
man	1
who	1
stood	1
before	1
him	1
but	1
the	1
task	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
completed	1
heaven	1
only	1
knows	1
what	1
the	1
people	1
here	1
may	1
imagine	1
muttered	1
telynin	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
moving	1
toward	1
a	1
small	1
empty	1
room	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
an	1
explanation	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
and	1
shall	1
prove	1
it	1
said	1
rostv	1
i	1
every	1
muscle	1
of	1
telynins	1
pale	1
terrified	1
face	1
began	1
to	1
quiver	1
his	1
eyes	1
still	1
shifted	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
downward	1
look	1
not	1
rising	1
to	1
rostvs	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
sobs	1
were	1
audible	1
count	1
dont	1
ruin	1
a	1
young	1
fellow	1
here	1
is	1
this	1
wretched	1
money	1
take	1

he	1
threw	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
i	1
have	1
an	1
old	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
rostv	1
took	1
the	1
money	1
avoiding	1
telynins	1
eyes	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
then	1
retraced	1
his	1
steps	1
o	1
god	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
count	1
said	1
telynin	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
dont	1
touch	1
me	1
said	1
rostv	1
drawing	1
back	1
if	1
you	1
need	1
it	1
take	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
he	1
threw	1
the	1
purse	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
chapter	1
v	1
that	1
same	1
evening	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
animated	1
discussion	1
among	1
the	1
squadrons	1
officers	1
in	1
densovs	1
quarters	1
and	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
rostv	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
apologize	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
said	1
a	1
tall	1
grizzlyhaired	1
staff	1
captain	1
with	1
enormous	1
mustaches	1
and	1
many	1
wrinkles	1
on	1
his	1
large	1
features	1
to	1
rostv	1
who	1
was	1
crimson	1
with	1
excitement	1
the	1
staff	1
captain	1
krsten	1
had	1
twice	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
for	1
affairs	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
had	1
twice	1
regained	1
his	1
commission	1
i	1
will	1
allow	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
call	1
me	1
a	1
liar	1
cried	1
rostv	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
i	1
lied	1
and	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
lied	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
rests	1
he	1
may	1
keep	1
me	1
on	1
duty	1
every	1
day	1
or	1
may	1
place	1
me	1
under	1
arrest	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
make	1
me	1
apologize	1
because	1
if	1
he	1
as	1
commander	1
of	1
this	1
regiment	1
thinks	1
it	1
beneath	1
his	1
dignity	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
satisfaction	1
then	1
you	1
just	1
wait	1
a	1
moment	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
and	1
listen	1
interrupted	1
the	1
staff	1
captain	1
in	1
his	1
deep	1
bass	1
calmly	1
stroking	1
his	1
long	1
mustache	1
you	1
tell	1
the	1
colonel	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
other	1
officers	1
that	1
an	1
officer	1
has	1
stolen	1
im	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
that	1
the	1
conversation	1
began	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
other	1
officers	1
perhaps	1
i	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
spoken	1
before	1
them	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
diplomatist	1
thats	1
why	1
i	1
joined	1
the	1
hussars	1
thinking	1
that	1
here	1
one	1
would	1
not	1
need	1
finesse	1
and	1
he	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
lyingso	1
let	1
him	1
give	1
me	1
satisfaction	1
thats	1
all	1
right	1
no	1
one	1
thinks	1
you	1
a	1
coward	1
but	1
thats	1
not	1
the	1
point	1
ask	1
densov	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
a	1
cadet	1
to	1
demand	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
his	1
regimental	1
commander	1
densov	1
sat	1
gloomily	1
biting	1
his	1
mustache	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
evidently	1
with	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
it	1
he	1
answered	1
the	1
staff	1
captains	1
question	1
by	1
a	1
disapproving	1
shake	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
you	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
about	1
this	1
nasty	1
business	1
before	1
other	1
officers	1
continued	1

and	1
bogdnich	1

untruth	1

talked	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
nonsense	1
to	1

and	1

apologize	1

on	1
any	1
account	1
exclaimed	1
rostv	1
i	1
did	1
not	1

of	1

seriously	1
and	1
severely	1

pointed	1
with	1
a	1

to	1
a	1

his	1

narrowed	1

the	1

standing	1
in	1

out	1
something	1

looked	1
through	1
his	1

yes	1

said	1
the	1

angrily	1
lowering	1
the	1

shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
theyll	1
be	1
fired	1
on	1
at	1
the	1

why	1

dawdling	1
there	1
on	1
the	1

by	1
the	1

from	1
their	1

a	1

could	1
be	1

repeated	1
the	1
order	1
that	1

already	1
once	1
been	1
given	1
in	1
detail	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1

rode	1
off	1
by	1
the	1

a	1

flew	1
above	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
our	1

below	1
the	1

two	1
of	1

already	1
flown	1
across	1
the	1

where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
crush	1
halfway	1
across	1
stood	1
prince	1
nesvtski	1
who	1
had	1
alighted	1
from	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
whose	1
big	1
body	1
was	1
jammed	1
against	1
the	1
railings	1
he	1
looked	1
back	1
laughing	1
to	1
the	1
cossack	1
who	1
stood	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
behind	1
him	1
holding	1
two	1
horses	1
by	1
their	1
bridles	1
each	1
time	1
prince	1
nesvtski	1
tried	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
soldiers	1

carts	1
pushed	1
him	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
pressed	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
railings	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
smile	1
what	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
you	1
are	1
friend	1
said	1
the	1
cossack	1
to	1
a	1
convoy	1
soldier	1
with	1
a	1
wagon	1
who	1
was	1
pressing	1
onto	1
the	1
infantrymen	1
who	1
were	1
crowded	1
together	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
wheels	1
and	1
his	1
horses	1
what	1
a	1
fellow	1
you	1
cant	1
wait	1
a	1
moment	1
dont	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
general	1
wants	1
to	1
pass	1
but	1
the	1
convoyman	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
word	1

and	1
shouted	1
at	1
the	1

the	1
soldiers	1
crowded	1
together	1
shoulder	1

shoulder	1
their	1
bayonets	1
interlocking	1
moved	1
over	1
the	1
bridge	1
in	1
a	1
dense	1
mass	1
looking	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
rails	1
prince	1
nesvtski	1
saw	1
the	1
rapid	1
noisy	1
little	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
enns	1
which	1
rippling	1
and	1
eddying	1
round	1
the	1
piles	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
chased	1
each	1
other	1
along	1
looking	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
he	1
saw	1
equally	1
uniform	1
living	1
waves	1
of	1
soldiers	1
shoulder	1
straps	1
covered	1
shakos	1
knapsacks	1
bayonets	1
long	1
muskets	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
shakos	1
faces	1
with	1
broad	1
cheekbones	1
sunken	1
cheeks	1
and	1
listless	1
tired	1
expressions	1
and	1
feet	1
that	1
moved	1
through	1
the	1
sticky	1
mud	1
that	1
covered	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
sometimes	1
through	1
the	1
monotonous	1
waves	1
of	1
men	1
like	1
a	1
fleck	1
of	1
white	1
foam	1
on	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
enns	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1
a	1
cloak	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
type	1
of	1
face	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
squeezed	1
his	1
way	1
along	1
sometimes	1
like	1
a	1
chip	1
of	1
wood	1
whirling	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
an	1
hussar	1
on	1
foot	1
an	1
orderly	1
or	1
a	1
townsman	1
was	1
carried	1
through	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
infantry	1
and	1
sometimes	1
like	1
a	1
log	1
floating	1
down	1
the	1

covered	1
and	1
hemmed	1
in	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
moved	1
across	1
the	1
bridge	1
its	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
dam	1
had	1
burst	1
said	1
the	1
cossack	1
hopelessly	1
are	1
there	1
many	1
more	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
a	1
million	1
all	1
but	1
one	1
replied	1
a	1
waggish	1
soldier	1
in	1
a	1
torn	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
wink	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
followed	1
by	1
another	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
if	1
he	1
he	1
meant	1
the	1
enemy	1
begins	1
popping	1
at	1
the	1
bridge	1
now	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
soldier	1
dismally	1
to	1
a	1
comrade	1
youll	1
forget	1
to	1
scratch	1
yourself	1
that	1
soldier	1
passed	1
on	1
and	1
after	1
him	1
came	1
another	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
cart	1
where	1
the	1
devil	1
have	1
the	1
leg	1
bands	1
been	1
shoved	1
to	1
said	1
an	1
orderly	1
running	1
behind	1
the	1
cart	1
and	1
fumbling	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
passed	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
wagon	1
then	1
came	1
some	1
merry	1
soldiers	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
drinking	1
and	1
then	1
old	1
fellow	1
he	1
gives	1
him	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
teeth	1
with	1
the	1
butt	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
gun	1
a	1
soldier	1
whose	1
greatcoat	1
was	1
well	1
tucked	1
up	1
said	1
gaily	1
with	1
a	1
wide	1
swing	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
yes	1
the	1
ham	1
was	1
just	1
delicious	1
answered	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
laugh	1
and	1
they	1
too	1
passed	1
on	1
so	1
that	1
nesvtski	1
did	1
not	1
learn	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
on	1
the	1
teeth	1
or	1
what	1
the	1
ham	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it	1
bah	1
how	1
they	1
scurry	1
he	1
just	1
sends	1
a	1
ball	1
and	1
they	1
think	1
theyll	1
all	1
be	1
killed	1
a	1
sergeant	1
was	1
saying	1
angrily	1
and	1
reproachfully	1
as	1
it	1
flies	1
past	1
me	1
daddy	1
the	1
ball	1
i	1
mean	1
said	1
a	1
young	1
soldier	1
with	1
an	1
enormous	1
mouth	1
hardly	1
refraining	1
from	1
laughing	1
i	1
felt	1
like	1
dying	1
of	1
fright	1
i	1
did	1
pon	1
my	1
word	1
i	1
got	1
that	1
frightened	1
said	1
he	1
as	1
if	1
bragging	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
frightened	1
that	1
one	1
also	1
passed	1
then	1
followed	1
a	1
cart	1
unlike	1
any	1
that	1
had	1
gone	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
german	1
cart	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1

as	1

the	1

closed	1
his	1

off	1
the	1

passed	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
by	1
the	1

stream	1
of	1
soldiers	1
followed	1
with	1
the	1

kind	1
of	1

and	1
at	1

all	1
stopped	1

at	1

all	1
pressed	1
toward	1
the	1

from	1

at	1

nesvtski	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
a	1
sound	1
new	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
something	1
swiftly	1
approaching	1
something	1
big	1
that	1
splashed	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
just	1
see	1
where	1
it	1
carries	1
to	1
a	1

round	1
at	1
the	1

another	1
uneasily	1
the	1

moved	1
on	1

realized	1
that	1

was	1
a	1

with	1
great	1

he	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
shouting	1
continually	1
he	1
moved	1
on	1
the	1
soldiers	1
squeezed	1
themselves	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
him	1
but	1
again	1
pressed	1
on	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
jammed	1
his	1
leg	1
and	1
those	1
nearest	1
him	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1

were	1
themselves	1
pressed	1
still	1

a	1

the	1

awaiting	1
the	1

a	1

flew	1
past	1
evidently	1
they	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
the	1
hussars	1

the	1
balls	1
with	1
rapid	1
rhythmic	1
whistle	1
flew	1
over	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
horsemen	1
and	1
fell	1
somewhere	1
beyond	1
them	1
the	1
hussars	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round	1

at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
each	1
shot	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
the	1
whole	1

with	1
its	1

of	1
faces	1
so	1
alike	1
yet	1
so	1
different	1
holding	1
its	1
breath	1
while	1
the	1
ball	1
flew	1
past	1
rose	1
in	1
the	1
stirrups	1
and	1
sank	1
back	1
again	1
the	1
soldiers	1
without	1
turning	1
their	1
heads	1
glanced	1
at	1
one	1

expression	1
of	1
conflict	1

and	1
excitement	1
around	1

and	1

the	1

an	1

in	1

himself	1
he	1
was	1
glancing	1
at	1
everyone	1
with	1
a	1
clear	1
bright	1
expression	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
them	1
to	1
notice	1
how	1
calmly	1
he	1
sat	1
under	1

despite	1
himself	1
on	1

too	1

unable	1

on	1
one	1

kept	1
turning	1
his	1
horse	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1

the	1
black	1
hairy	1
snubnosed	1
face	1
of	1

his	1

sturdy	1
figure	1
with	1
the	1
sinewy	1
hairy	1
hand	1

stumpy	1
fingers	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
his	1
naked	1
saber	1
looked	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
usually	1
did	1
especially	1
toward	1
evening	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
emptied	1
his	1
second	1
bottle	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
redder	1
than	1
usual	1
with	1
his	1
shaggy	1
head	1
thrown	1
back	1
like	1
birds	1
when	1
they	1

pressing	1
his	1
spurs	1
mercilessly	1
into	1
the	1

of	1
his	1
good	1
horse	1
bedouin	1
and	1
sitting	1
as	1
though	1
falling	1
backwards	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
he	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
squadron	1
and	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
to	1
look	1
to	1
their	1

up	1

at	1
a	1
walk	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
long	1

was	1
serious	1
as	1
always	1
only	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
brighter	1
than	1

well	1
what	1
about	1

cried	1
noticing	1
the	1
cadets	1
bright	1
face	1
youve	1
got	1
it	1
at	1

and	1
he	1
smiled	1
approvingly	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
cadet	1
rostv	1
felt	1
perfectly	1
happy	1
just	1
then	1
the	1
commander	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
densov	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
your	1

indeed	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
in	1
a	1
bored	1
voice	1
puckering	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
if	1
driving	1
off	1
a	1
troublesome	1
fly	1
and	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
stopping	1
here	1
dont	1
you	1

the	1
skirmishers	1
are	1
retreating	1
lead	1
the	1
squadron	1
back	1
the	1
squadron	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
drew	1
out	1
of	1
range	1
of	1
fire	1
without	1
having	1
lost	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
the	1
second	1
squadron	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
line	1
followed	1
them	1
across	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
cossacks	1
quitted	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
the	1
two	1
pvlograd	1
squadrons	1
having	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge	1
retired	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
their	1
colonel	1
karl	1
bogdnich	1
schubert	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
densovs	1
squadron	1
and	1
rode	1
at	1
a	1
footpace	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
rostv	1
without	1
taking	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
him	1
although	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
meeting	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
their	1
encounter	1
concerning	1
telynin	1
rostv	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
toward	1
whom	1
he	1
now	1
admitted	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
blame	1
did	1
not	1
lift	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
colonels	1
athletic	1
back	1
his	1
nape	1
covered	1
with	1
light	1
hair	1
and	1
his	1
red	1
neck	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
rostv	1
that	1
bogdnich	1
was	1
only	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
aim	1
now	1
was	1
to	1
test	1
the	1
cadets	1
courage	1
so	1
he	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
and	1
looked	1
around	1
him	1
merrily	1
then	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
bogdnich	1
rode	1
so	1
near	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
his	1
courage	1
next	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
his	1
enemy	1
would	1
send	1
the	1
squadron	1
on	1
a	1
desperate	1
attack	1
just	1
to	1
punish	1
himrostv	1
then	1
he	1
imagined	1
how	1
after	1
the	1
attack	1
bogdnich	1
would	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
wounded	1
and	1
would	1
magnanimously	1
extend	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
reconciliation	1
the	1
highshouldered	1
figure	1
of	1
zherkv	1
familiar	1
to	1
the	1
pvlograds	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
recently	1
left	1
their	1
regiment	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
after	1
his	1
dismissal	1
from	1
headquarters	1
zherkv	1
had	1
not	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
saying	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
fool	1
as	1
to	1
slave	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
more	1
rewards	1
by	1
doing	1
nothing	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
and	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
attaching	1
himself	1
as	1
an	1
orderly	1
officer	1
to	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
he	1
now	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
chief	1
with	1
an	1
order	1
from	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
rear	1
guard	1
colonel	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
rostvs	1
enemy	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
gloomy	1
gravity	1
and	1
glancing	1
round	1
at	1
his	1
comrades	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
stop	1
and	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
who	1
asked	1
the	1
colonel	1
morosely	1
i	1
dont	1
myself	1
know	1
to	1
who	1
replied	1
the	1
cornet	1
in	1
a	1
serious	1
tone	1
but	1
the	1
prince	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
colonel	1
that	1
the	1
hussars	1
must	1
return	1
quickly	1
and	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge	1
zherkv	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
who	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
hussars	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
order	1
after	1
him	1
the	1
stout	1
nesvtski	1
came	1
galloping	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
cossack	1
horse	1
that	1
could	1
scarcely	1
carry	1
his	1
weight	1
hows	1
this	1
colonel	1
he	1
shouted	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
now	1
someone	1
has	1
gone	1
and	1
blundered	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
beside	1
themselves	1
over	1
there	1
and	1
one	1
cant	1
make	1
anything	1
out	1
the	1
colonel	1
deliberately	1
stopped	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
nesvtski	1
you	1
spoke	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
inflammable	1
material	1
said	1
he	1
but	1
you	1
said	1
nothing	1
about	1
firing	1
it	1
but	1
my	1
dear	1
sir	1
said	1
nesvtski	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
up	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
smoothing	1
his	1
hair	1
wet	1
with	1
perspiration	1
with	1
his	1
plump	1
hand	1
wasnt	1
i	1
telling	1
you	1

i	1
am	1
not	1
your	1
dear	1

mr	1
staff	1

and	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
to	1
burn	1
the	1
bridge	1
i	1
know	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
habit	1
orders	1
strictly	1
to	1
obey	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
bridge	1
would	1
be	1
burned	1
but	1
who	1
would	1
it	1
burn	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
by	1
the	1
holy	1
spirit	1
ah	1
thats	1
always	1
the	1
way	1
said	1
nesvtski	1
with	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
here	1
said	1
he	1
turning	1
to	1
zherkv	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
business	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
damp	1
let	1
me	1
wring	1
you	1
out	1
you	1
were	1
saying	1
mr	1
staff	1
officer	1
continued	1
the	1
colonel	1
in	1
an	1
offended	1
tone	1
colonel	1
interrupted	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
quick	1
or	1
the	1
enemy	1
will	1
bring	1
up	1
his	1
guns	1
to	1
use	1
grapeshot	1
the	1
colonel	1
looked	1
silently	1
at	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
at	1
the	1
stout	1
staff	1
officer	1
and	1
at	1
zherkv	1
and	1
he	1
frowned	1
i	1
will	1
the	1
bridge	1
fire	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
solemn	1
tone	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
unpleasantness	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
endure	1
he	1
would	1
still	1
do	1
the	1
right	1
thing	1
striking	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
muscular	1
legs	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
everything	1
the	1
colonel	1
moved	1
forward	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
second	1
squadron	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
rostv	1
was	1
serving	1
under	1
densov	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
bridge	1
there	1
its	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
thought	1
said	1
rostv	1
to	1
himself	1
he	1
wishes	1
to	1
test	1
me	1
his	1
heart	1
contracted	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1
face	1
let	1
him	1
see	1
whether	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
coward	1
he	1
thought	1
again	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
bright	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
squadron	1
the	1
serious	1
expression	1
appeared	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
worn	1
when	1
under	1
fire	1
rostv	1
watched	1
his	1
enemy	1
the	1
colonel	1
closelyto	1
find	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
confirmation	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
conjecture	1
but	1
the	1
colonel	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
glance	1
at	1
rostv	1
and	1
looked	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
when	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
solemn	1
and	1
stern	1
then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
look	1
sharp	1
look	1
sharp	1
several	1
voices	1
repeated	1
around	1
him	1
their	1
sabers	1
catching	1
in	1
the	1
bridles	1
and	1
their	1
spurs	1
jingling	1
the	1
hussars	1
hastily	1
dismounted	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
crossing	1
themselves	1
rostv	1
no	1
longer	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
colonel	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
falling	1
behind	1
the	1
hussars	1
so	1
much	1
afraid	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
stood	1
still	1
his	1
hand	1
trembled	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
horse	1
into	1
an	1
orderlys	1
charge	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
blood	1
rush	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
with	1
a	1
thud	1
densov	1
rode	1
past	1
him	1
leaning	1
back	1
and	1
shouting	1
something	1
rostv	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
hussars	1
running	1
all	1
around	1
him	1
their	1
spurs	1
catching	1
and	1
their	1
sabers	1
clattering	1
stretchers	1
shouted	1
someone	1
behind	1
him	1
rostv	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
what	1
this	1
call	1
for	1
stretchers	1
meant	1
he	1
ran	1
on	1
trying	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
but	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
bridge	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
ground	1
he	1
came	1
on	1
some	1
sticky	1
trodden	1
mud	1
stumbled	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
the	1
others	1
outstripped	1
him	1
at	1
boss	1
zides	1
captain	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
colonel	1
who	1
having	1
ridden	1
ahead	1
had	1
pulled	1
up	1
his	1
horse	1
near	1
the	1
bridge	1
with	1
a	1
triumphant	1
cheerful	1
face	1
rostv	1
wiping	1
his	1
muddy	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
breeches	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
enemy	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
run	1
on	1
thinking	1
that	1
the	1
farther	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
the	1

nesvtski	1

the	1

were	1
standing	1
together	1
out	1
of	1

of	1

the	1

of	1
the	1

on	1
the	1

the	1

the	1

in	1
the	1

with	1
their	1

ugh	1

now	1
he	1
shouldnt	1
have	1
taken	1
so	1
many	1
men	1
said	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1

true	1
enough	1
answered	1
nesvtski	1
two	1
smart	1
fellows	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
job	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
ah	1
your	1
excellency	1
put	1
in	1
zherkv	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
hussars	1
but	1
still	1
with	1
that	1
nave	1
air	1
that	1
made	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
in	1
jest	1
or	1
in	1
earnest	1
ah	1
your	1
excellency	1
how	1
you	1
look	1
at	1

send	1
two	1
men	1
and	1
who	1
then	1
would	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
vladmir	1

but	1
now	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
get	1
peppered	1
the	1
squadron	1
may	1
be	1
recommended	1
for	1
honors	1
and	1
he	1
may	1
get	1
a	1

our	1
bogdnich	1

now	1

pointed	1
to	1
the	1

the	1

were	1

hurriedly	1
removed	1
on	1
the	1
french	1
side	1
amid	1
the	1
groups	1
with	1
cannon	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
smoke	1
appeared	1
then	1
a	1

a	1

almost	1
simultaneously	1

at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1

was	1

a	1
fourth	1
was	1

then	1
two	1
reports	1
one	1
after	1
another	1

a	1
third	1
oh	1
oh	1
groaned	1
nesvtski	1
as	1

nesvtski	1
turning	1
away	1
the	1
french	1
guns	1
were	1
hastily	1
reloaded	1
the	1

in	1
their	1
blue	1
uniforms	1
advanced	1
toward	1
the	1

at	1
a	1
run	1
smoke	1
appeared	1
again	1
but	1
at	1
irregular	1
intervals	1
and	1
grapeshot	1
cracked	1
and	1
rattled	1
onto	1
the	1
bridge	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
nesvtski	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
there	1
as	1
a	1
dense	1
cloud	1
of	1
smoke	1
arose	1
from	1
it	1
the	1
hussars	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
setting	1
it	1
on	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
french	1
batteries	1
were	1
now	1
firing	1
at	1
them	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
hinder	1
them	1
but	1
because	1
the	1
guns	1
were	1
trained	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
someone	1
to	1
fire	1
at	1
the	1
french	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
fire	1
three	1
rounds	1
of	1
grapeshot	1
before	1
the	1
hussars	1
got	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
horses	1
two	1
were	1
misdirected	1
and	1
the	1
shot	1
went	1
too	1
high	1
but	1
the	1
last	1
round	1
fell	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
a	1

on	1
the	1

not	1

there	1

no	1

down	1
as	1
he	1

imagined	1
battles	1
to	1
himself	1
nor	1
could	1
he	1
help	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1

because	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
brought	1
any	1
burning	1
straw	1
with	1
him	1
like	1
the	1
other	1
soldiers	1
he	1
stood	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
when	1
suddenly	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
rattle	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
as	1
if	1
nuts	1
were	1
being	1
spilt	1
and	1
the	1
hussar	1
nearest	1
to	1
him	1
fell	1
against	1
the	1
rails	1
with	1
a	1
groan	1

up	1
to	1

with	1

began	1
lifting	1
him	1
oooh	1
for	1
christs	1
sake	1
let	1
me	1
alone	1
cried	1

was	1

turned	1
away	1

as	1
if	1
searching	1
for	1

gazed	1
into	1
the	1
distance	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1

at	1

at	1

the	1

no	1

the	1
very	1
devil	1
with	1
them	1
shooting	1
at	1
you	1

and	1
densov	1
rode	1
up	1

the	1

well	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
has	1
noticed	1

this	1
was	1
true	1
no	1

the	1

which	1
the	1

was	1
a	1

that	1

now	1

left	1
with	1
only	1
his	1
own	1
weak	1

exhausted	1
forces	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1

was	1
no	1

of	1

the	1

at	1

with	1

were	1
running	1
away	1

that	1

was	1

six	1

were	1
eating	1

the	1
more	1
severely	1
wounded	1
looked	1
silently	1
with	1
the	1
languid	1
interest	1
of	1
sick	1
children	1
at	1
the	1
envoy	1
hurrying	1
past	1
them	1
prince	1
andrew	1
told	1
his	1

to	1
stop	1

asked	1
a	1

in	1
what	1
action	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
wounded	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
on	1
the	1

answered	1
the	1

prince	1
andrew	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
purse	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
soldier	1
three	1
gold	1
pieces	1
thats	1
for	1
them	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1

who	1
came	1
up	1

well	1
soon	1
lads	1
he	1
continued	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1

theres	1
plenty	1
to	1
do	1
still	1
what	1
news	1

asked	1
the	1
officer	1
evidently	1
anxious	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation	1
good	1
news	1
go	1
on	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
driver	1
and	1
they	1
galloped	1
on	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
quite	1
dark	1
when	1
prince	1
andrew	1
rattled	1
over	1
the	1
paved	1
streets	1
of	1
brnn	1
and	1
found	1
himself	1
surrounded	1
by	1
high	1
buildings	1
the	1
lights	1
of	1
shops	1
houses	1
and	1
street	1
lamps	1
fine	1
carriages	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
active	1
town	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
so	1
attractive	1
to	1
a	1
soldier	1
after	1
camp	1
life	1
despite	1
his	1
rapid	1
journey	1
and	1
sleepless	1
night	1
prince	1
andrew	1
when	1
he	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
palace	1
felt	1
even	1
more	1
vigorous	1
and	1
alert	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
only	1
his	1
eyes	1
gleamed	1
feverishly	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
followed	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
clearness	1
and	1
rapidity	1
he	1
again	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
no	1
longer	1
dim	1
but	1
definite	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
concise	1
form	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
imagined	1
himself	1
stating	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
emperor	1
francis	1
he	1
vividly	1
imagined	1
the	1
casual	1
questions	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
answers	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
he	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
once	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
emperor	1
at	1
the	1
chief	1
entrance	1
to	1
the	1
palace	1
however	1
an	1
official	1
came	1
running	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
learning	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
special	1
messenger	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
another	1
entrance	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
from	1
the	1
corridor	1
euer	1
hochgeboren	1
there	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
the	1
adjutant	1
on	1
duty	1
said	1
the	1
official	1
he	1
will	1
conduct	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
war	1
the	1
adjutant	1
on	1
duty	1
meeting	1
prince	1
andrew	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
wait	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
war	1
five	1
minutes	1
later	1
he	1
returned	1
and	1
bowing	1
with	1
particular	1
courtesy	1
ushered	1
prince	1
andrew	1
before	1
him	1
along	1
a	1
corridor	1
to	1
the	1
cabinet	1
where	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
war	1
was	1
at	1
work	1
the	1
adjutant	1
by	1
his	1
elaborate	1
courtesy	1
appeared	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
ward	1
off	1
any	1
attempt	1
at	1
familiarity	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
messenger	1
prince	1
andrews	1
joyous	1
feeling	1
was	1
considerably	1
weakened	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
ministers	1
room	1
he	1
felt	1
offended	1
and	1
without	1
his	1
noticing	1
it	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
offense	1
immediately	1
turned	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
disdain	1
which	1
was	1
quite	1
uncalled	1
for	1
his	1
fertile	1
mind	1
instantly	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
which	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
despise	1
the	1
adjutant	1
and	1
the	1
minister	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
powder	1
they	1
probably	1
think	1
it	1
easy	1
to	1
gain	1
victories	1
he	1
thought	1
his	1
eyes	1
narrowed	1
disdainfully	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
war	1
with	1
peculiarly	1
deliberate	1
steps	1
this	1
feeling	1
of	1
disdain	1
was	1
heightened	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
minister	1
seated	1
at	1
a	1
large	1
table	1
reading	1
some	1
papers	1
and	1
making	1
pencil	1
notes	1
on	1
them	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
minutes	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
a	1
wax	1
candle	1
stood	1
at	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ministers	1
bent	1
bald	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
gray	1
temples	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
reading	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
footsteps	1
take	1
this	1
and	1
deliver	1
it	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
adjutant	1
handing	1
him	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
still	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
special	1
messenger	1
prince	1
andrew	1
felt	1
that	1
either	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
kutzovs	1
army	1
interested	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
war	1
less	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
matters	1
he	1
was	1
concerned	1
with	1
or	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
russian	1
special	1
messenger	1
that	1
impression	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
minister	1
drew	1
the	1
remaining	1
papers	1
together	1
arranged	1
them	1
evenly	1
and	1
then	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
intellectual	1
and	1
distinctive	1
head	1
but	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
prince	1
andrew	1
the	1
firm	1
intelligent	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
changed	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
evidently	1
deliberate	1
and	1
habitual	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
face	1
took	1
on	1
the	1
stupid	1
artificial	1
smile	1
which	1
does	1
not	1
even	1
attempt	1
to	1
hide	1
its	1
artificiality	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
continually	1
receiving	1
many	1
petitioners	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
from	1
general	1
field	1
marshal	1
kutzov	1
he	1
asked	1
i	1
hope	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
news	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
an	1
encounter	1
with	1
mortier	1
a	1
victory	1
it	1
was	1
high	1
time	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
dispatch	1
which	1
was	1
addressed	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
mournful	1
expression	1
oh	1
my	1
god	1
my	1
god	1
schmidt	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
german	1
what	1
a	1
calamity	1
what	1
a	1
calamity	1
having	1
glanced	1
through	1
the	1
dispatch	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
prince	1
andrew	1
evidently	1
considering	1
something	1
ah	1
what	1
a	1
calamity	1
you	1
say	1
the	1
affair	1
was	1
decisive	1
but	1
mortier	1
is	1
not	1
captured	1
again	1
he	1
pondered	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
have	1
brought	1
good	1
news	1
though	1
schmidts	1
death	1
is	1
a	1
heavy	1
price	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
victory	1
his	1
majesty	1
will	1
no	1
doubt	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
but	1
not	1
today	1
i	1
thank	1
you	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
rest	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
levee	1
tomorrow	1
after	1
the	1
parade	1
however	1
i	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
stupid	1
smile	1
which	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
face	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
reappeared	1
au	1
revoir	1
thank	1
you	1
very	1
much	1
his	1
majesty	1
will	1
probably	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
he	1
added	1
bowing	1
his	1
head	1
when	1
prince	1
andrew	1
left	1
the	1
palace	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
interest	1
and	1
happiness	1
the	1
victory	1
had	1
afforded	1
him	1
had	1
been	1
now	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
indifferent	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
the	1
polite	1
adjutant	1
the	1
whole	1
tenor	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts	1
instantaneously	1
changed	1
the	1

seemed	1
the	1

of	1

down	1
comfortably	1
beside	1

as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1

after	1

reception	1
by	1

to	1

had	1
known	1
each	1
other	1
previously	1
in	1
petersburg	1
but	1
had	1
become	1
more	1
intimate	1
when	1
prince	1
andrew	1
was	1
in	1
vienna	1
with	1
kutzov	1
just	1
as	1
prince	1
andrew	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
gave	1
promise	1
of	1
rising	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
military	1
profession	1
so	1
to	1
an	1
even	1
greater	1
extent	1
bilbin	1
gave	1
promise	1
of	1
rising	1
in	1
his	1
diplomatic	1
career	1
he	1
still	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
but	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
young	1
diplomat	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
service	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
sixteen	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
paris	1
and	1
copenhagen	1
and	1
now	1
held	1
a	1
rather	1
important	1
post	1
in	1
vienna	1
both	1
the	1
foreign	1
minister	1
and	1
our	1
ambassador	1
in	1
vienna	1
knew	1
him	1
and	1
valued	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
many	1
diplomats	1
who	1
are	1
esteemed	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
certain	1
negative	1
qualities	1
avoid	1
doing	1
certain	1
things	1
and	1
speak	1
french	1
he	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
liking	1
work	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
and	1
despite	1
his	1
indolence	1
would	1
sometimes	1
spend	1
a	1
whole	1
night	1
at	1
his	1
writing	1
table	1
he	1
worked	1
well	1
whatever	1
the	1
import	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
question	1
what	1
for	1
but	1
the	1
question	1
how	1
that	1
interested	1
him	1
what	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
matter	1
might	1
be	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
but	1
it	1
gave	1
him	1
great	1
pleasure	1
to	1
prepare	1
a	1
circular	1
memorandum	1
or	1
report	1
skillfully	1
pointedly	1
and	1
elegantly	1
bilbins	1
services	1
were	1
valued	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
wrote	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
his	1
skill	1
in	1
dealing	1
and	1
conversing	1
with	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
spheres	1
bilbin	1
liked	1
conversation	1
as	1
he	1
liked	1
work	1
only	1
when	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
elegantly	1
witty	1
in	1
society	1
he	1
always	1
awaited	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
striking	1
and	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
conversation	1
only	1
when	1
that	1
was	1
possible	1
his	1
conversation	1
was	1
always	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
wittily	1
original	1
finished	1
phrases	1
of	1
general	1
interest	1
these	1
sayings	1
were	1
prepared	1
in	1
the	1
inner	1
laboratory	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
in	1
a	1
portable	1
form	1
as	1
if	1
intentionally	1
so	1
that	1
insignificant	1
society	1
people	1
might	1
carry	1
them	1
from	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
bilbins	1
witticisms	1
were	1
hawked	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
viennese	1
drawing	1
rooms	1
and	1
often	1
had	1
an	1
influence	1
on	1
matters	1
considered	1
important	1
his	1
thin	1
worn	1
sallow	1
face	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
deep	1
wrinkles	1
which	1
always	1
looked	1
as	1
clean	1
and	1
well	1
washed	1
as	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
ones	1
fingers	1
after	1
a	1
russian	1
bath	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
these	1
wrinkles	1
formed	1
the	1
principal	1
play	1
of	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
now	1
his	1
forehead	1
would	1
pucker	1
into	1
deep	1
folds	1
and	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
were	1
lifted	1
then	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
would	1
descend	1
and	1
deep	1
wrinkles	1
would	1
crease	1
his	1
cheeks	1
his	1
small	1
deepset	1
eyes	1
always	1
twinkled	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
straight	1
well	1
now	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
your	1
exploits	1
said	1
he	1
bolknski	1
very	1
modestly	1
without	1
once	1
mentioning	1
himself	1
described	1
the	1
engagement	1
and	1
his	1
reception	1
by	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
war	1
they	1
received	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
news	1
as	1
one	1
receives	1
a	1
dog	1
in	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
skittles	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
conclusion	1
bilbin	1
smiled	1
and	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
disappeared	1

with	1
all	1
my	1

for	1

i	1
must	1
say	1
that	1
your	1
victory	1
was	1
not	1
particularly	1
victorious	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
in	1
french	1
uttering	1
only	1
those	1
words	1
in	1
russian	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
contemptuous	1

come	1
now	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
forces	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
unfortunate	1

his	1

and	1
even	1
then	1

slips	1
through	1
your	1

wheres	1
the	1
victory	1
but	1
seriously	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
we	1
can	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
say	1
without	1
boasting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
better	1
than	1
at	1
ulm	1
why	1
didnt	1
you	1
capture	1
one	1
just	1
one	1
marshal	1
for	1
us	1
because	1
not	1
everything	1
happens	1
as	1
one	1
expects	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
smoothness	1
of	1
a	1
parade	1
we	1
had	1
expected	1
as	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
their	1
rear	1
by	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
reached	1
it	1
by	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
and	1
why	1
didnt	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
at	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
there	1
at	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
returned	1
bilbin	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
there	1
at	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
impressing	1
on	1
bonaparte	1
by	1
diplomatic	1
methods	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
better	1
leave	1
genoa	1
alone	1
retorted	1
prince	1
andrew	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
i	1
know	1
interrupted	1
bilbin	1
youre	1
thinking	1
its	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
take	1
marshals	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
is	1
true	1
but	1
still	1
why	1
didnt	1
you	1
capture	1
him	1
so	1
dont	1
be	1
surprised	1
if	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
war	1
but	1
also	1
his	1
most	1
august	1
majesty	1
the	1
emperor	1
and	1
king	1
francis	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
delighted	1
by	1
your	1
victory	1
even	1
i	1
a	1
poor	1
secretary	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
embassy	1
do	1
not	1
feel	1
any	1
need	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
my	1
joy	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
franz	1
a	1
thaler	1

go	1
with	1
his	1

to	1
the	1
prater	1
true	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
prater	1
here	1
he	1
looked	1
straight	1
at	1
prince	1
andrew	1
and	1
suddenly	1
unwrinkled	1
his	1
forehead	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
my	1
turn	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
why	1
mon	1
cher	1
said	1
bolknski	1
i	1
confess	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
perhaps	1
there	1
are	1
diplomatic	1
subtleties	1
here	1
beyond	1
my	1
feeble	1
intelligence	1
but	1
i	1
cant	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
mack	1
loses	1
a	1
whole	1
army	1
the	1
archduke	1
ferdinand	1
and	1
the	1

no	1

and	1
make	1
blunder	1
after	1
blunder	1
kutzov	1
alone	1
at	1
last	1
gains	1
a	1
real	1
victory	1
destroying	1
the	1
spell	1
of	1
the	1
invincibility	1
of	1
the	1
french	1
and	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
war	1
does	1
not	1
even	1
care	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
details	1
thats	1
just	1
it	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
you	1
see	1
its	1
hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
tsar	1
for	1
russia	1
for	1
the	1
orthodox	1
greek	1
faith	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
beautiful	1
but	1
what	1
do	1
we	1
i	1
mean	1
the	1
austrian	1
court	1
care	1
for	1
your	1
victories	1
bring	1
us	1
nice	1
news	1
of	1
a	1
victory	1
by	1
the	1
archduke	1
karl	1
or	1
ferdinand	1
one	1
archdukes	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
another	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
over	1
a	1
fire	1
brigade	1
of	1
bonapartes	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
another	1
story	1
and	1
well	1
fire	1
off	1
some	1
cannon	1
but	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
seems	1
done	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
vex	1
us	1
the	1
archduke	1
karl	1
does	1
nothing	1
the	1
archduke	1
ferdinand	1
disgraces	1
himself	1
you	1
abandon	1
vienna	1
give	1
up	1
its	1
defenseas	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
heaven	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
but	1
heaven	1
help	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
capital	1
the	1
one	1
general	1
whom	1
we	1
all	1
loved	1
schmidt	1
you	1
expose	1
to	1
a	1
bullet	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
congratulate	1
us	1
on	1
the	1
victory	1
admit	1
that	1
more	1
irritating	1
news	1
than	1
yours	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
conceived	1
its	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
on	1
purpose	1
on	1
purpose	1
besides	1
suppose	1
you	1
did	1
gain	1
a	1
brilliant	1
victory	1
if	1
even	1
the	1
archduke	1
karl	1
gained	1
a	1
victory	1
what	1
effect	1
would	1
that	1
have	1
on	1
the	1
general	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
its	1
too	1
late	1
now	1
when	1
vienna	1
is	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
french	1
army	1
what	1
occupied	1
vienna	1
occupied	1
not	1
only	1
occupied	1
but	1
bonaparte	1
is	1
at	1
schnbrunn	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
our	1
dear	1
count	1
vrbna	1
goes	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
orders	1
after	1
the	1
fatigues	1
and	1
impressions	1
of	1
the	1
journey	1
his	1
reception	1
and	1
especially	1
after	1
having	1
dined	1
bolknski	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
heard	1
count	1
lichtenfels	1
was	1
here	1
this	1
morning	1
bilbin	1
continued	1
and	1
showed	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
parade	1
of	1
the	1
french	1
in	1
vienna	1
was	1
fully	1
described	1
prince	1
murat	1
et	1
tout	1
le	1
tremblement	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
victory	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
matter	1
for	1
great	1
rejoicing	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
cant	1
be	1
received	1
as	1
a	1
savior	1
really	1
i	1
dont	1
care	1
about	1
that	1
i	1
dont	1
care	1
at	1
all	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
beginning	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
his	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
before	1
krems	1
was	1
really	1
of	1
small	1
importance	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
such	1
events	1
as	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
austrias	1
capital	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
vienna	1
was	1
taken	1
what	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
its	1
celebrated	1
bridgehead	1
and	1
prince	1
auersperg	1
we	1
heard	1
reports	1
that	1
prince	1
auersperg	1
was	1
defending	1
vienna	1
he	1
said	1
prince	1
auersperg	1
is	1
on	1
this	1
on	1
our	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
is	1
defending	1
usdoing	1
it	1
very	1
badly	1
i	1
think	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
is	1
defending	1
us	1
but	1
vienna	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
no	1
the	1
bridge	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
taken	1
and	1
i	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
mined	1
and	1
orders	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
blow	1
it	1
up	1
otherwise	1
we	1
should	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
bohemia	1
and	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
army	1
would	1
have	1
spent	1
a	1
bad	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
between	1
two	1
fires	1
but	1
still	1
this	1
does	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
the	1
campaign	1
is	1
over	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
well	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
bigwigs	1
here	1
think	1
so	1
too	1
but	1
they	1
darent	1
say	1
so	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
i	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
it	1
wont	1
be	1
your	1
skirmishing	1
at	1
drrenstein	1
or	1
gunpowder	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
will	1
decide	1
the	1
matter	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
devised	1
it	1
said	1
bilbin	1
quoting	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
mots	1
releasing	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
pausing	1
the	1
only	1
question	1
is	1
what	1
will	1
come	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
between	1
the	1
emperor	1
alexander	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
prussia	1
in	1
berlin	1
if	1
prussia	1
joins	1
the	1
allies	1
austrias	1
hand	1
will	1
be	1
forced	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
war	1
if	1
not	1
it	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
settling	1
where	1
the	1
preliminaries	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
campo	1
formio	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
up	1
what	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
genius	1
prince	1
andrew	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed	1
clenching	1
his	1
small	1
hand	1
and	1
striking	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
what	1
luck	1
the	1
man	1
has	1
buonaparte	1
said	1
bilbin	1
inquiringly	1
puckering	1
up	1
his	1
forehead	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
witty	1
buonaparte	1
he	1
repeated	1
accentuating	1
the	1
u	1
i	1
think	1
however	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
lays	1
down	1
laws	1
for	1
austria	1
at	1
schnbrunn	1
il	1
faut	1
lui	1
faire	1
grce	1
de	1
lu	1
i	1
shall	1
certainly	1
adopt	1
an	1
innovation	1
and	1
call	1
him	1
simply	1
bonaparte	1
we	1
must	1

fool	1
of	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
she	1
will	1
retaliate	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
fooled	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
because	1
her	1
provinces	1

been	1

thereforethis	1

instinctively	1

that	1
we	1
are	1
being	1

that	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
base	1
if	1
we	1
live	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
replied	1
bilbin	1
his	1
face	1
again	1
becoming	1
smooth	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
when	1
prince	1
andrew	1
reached	1
the	1
room	1
prepared	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
shirt	1
on	1
the	1
feather	1
bed	1
with	1
its	1
warmed	1
and	1
fragrant	1
pillows	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
tidings	1
was	1
far	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
alliance	1
with	1
prussia	1
austrias	1
treachery	1
bonapartes	1
new	1
triumph	1
tomorrows	1
levee	1
and	1
parade	1
and	1
the	1
audience	1
with	1
the	1
emperor	1
francis	1
occupied	1
his	1
thoughts	1
he	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
immediately	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
cannonading	1
of	1
musketry	1
and	1
the	1
rattling	1
of	1
carriage	1
wheels	1
seemed	1
to	1
fill	1
his	1
ears	1
and	1
now	1
again	1
drawn	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
thin	1
line	1
the	1
musketeers	1
were	1
descending	1
the	1
hill	1
the	1
french	1
were	1
firing	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
his	1
heart	1
palpitating	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
forward	1
beside	1
schmidt	1
with	1
the	1
bullets	1
merrily	1
whistling	1
all	1
around	1
and	1
he	1
experienced	1
tenfold	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
living	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
since	1
childhood	1
he	1
woke	1
up	1
yes	1
that	1
all	1
happened	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
smiling	1
happily	1
to	1
himself	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
deep	1
youthful	1
slumber	1
chapter	1
xi	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
woke	1
late	1
recalling	1
his	1
recent	1
impressions	1
the	1
first	1
thought	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
that	1
today	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
emperor	1
francis	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
war	1
the	1
polite	1
austrian	1
adjutant	1
bilbin	1
and	1
last	1
nights	1
conversation	1
having	1
dressed	1
for	1
his	1
attendance	1
at	1
court	1
in	1
full	1
parade	1
uniform	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
worn	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
bilbins	1
study	1
fresh	1
animated	1
and	1
handsome	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
bandaged	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
were	1
four	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
corps	1
with	1
prince	1
hippolyte	1
kurgin	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
secretary	1
to	1
the	1
embassy	1
bolknski	1
was	1
already	1
acquainted	1
bilbin	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
assembled	1
at	1
bilbins	1
were	1
young	1
wealthy	1
gay	1
society	1
men	1
who	1
here	1
as	1
in	1
vienna	1
formed	1
a	1
special	1
set	1
which	1
bilbin	1
their	1
leader	1
called	1
les	1
ntres	1
this	1
set	1
consisting	1
almost	1
exclusively	1
of	1
diplomats	1
evidently	1
had	1
its	1
own	1
interests	1
which	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
war	1
or	1
politics	1
but	1
related	1
to	1
high	1
society	1
to	1
certain	1
women	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
official	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
received	1
prince	1
andrew	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
themselves	1
an	1
honor	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
extend	1
to	1
many	1
from	1
politeness	1
and	1
to	1
start	1
conversation	1
they	1
asked	1
him	1
a	1
few	1
questions	1
about	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
talk	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
merry	1
jests	1
and	1
gossip	1
ours	1
but	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
one	1
telling	1
of	1
the	1
misfortune	1
of	1
a	1
fellow	1
diplomat	1
that	1
the	1
chancellor	1
told	1
him	1
flatly	1
that	1
his	1
appointment	1
to	1
london	1
was	1
a	1
promotion	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
to	1
regard	1
it	1
can	1
you	1
fancy	1
the	1
figure	1
he	1
cut	1
but	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it	1

of	1

was	1
lolling	1
in	1
a	1
lounge	1
chair	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
over	1
its	1
arm	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
oh	1

turning	1
to	1
prince	1

that	1

the	1
rest	1
of	1

burst	1
out	1
laughing	1
in	1
hippolytes	1
face	1
and	1
prince	1
andrew	1
saw	1
that	1
hippolyte	1
of	1
whomhe	1
had	1
to	1
admithe	1
had	1
almost	1
been	1
jealous	1
on	1

the	1

of	1
this	1

should	1
see	1
his	1
gravity	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
hippolyte	1
and	1
wrinkling	1
his	1
forehead	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
politics	1
prince	1
andrew	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
gathered	1
round	1
these	1
two	1
the	1
berlin	1
cabinet	1
cannot	1
express	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
alliance	1
began	1
hippolyte	1
gazing	1
round	1
with	1
importance	1
at	1
the	1
others	1
without	1
expressing	1
as	1
in	1
its	1
last	1
note	1
you	1

besides	1

from	1
the	1

of	1
our	1
alliance	1

not	1
finished	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
prince	1
andrew	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
i	1
believe	1
that	1
intervention	1
will	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
nonintervention	1
and	1
he	1
paused	1
finally	1
one	1
cannot	1
impute	1
the	1
nonreceipt	1
of	1
our	1
dispatch	1
of	1
november	1
that	1
is	1
how	1
it	1
will	1
end	1
and	1
he	1
released	1
bolknskis	1
arm	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
quite	1
finished	1
demosthenes	1
i	1

thee	1
by	1
the	1

bilbin	1
and	1
the	1
mop	1
of	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
moved	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
everybody	1
laughed	1
and	1
hippolyte	1
louder	1
than	1
anyone	1
he	1
was	1
evidently	1
distressed	1
and	1
breathed	1
painfully	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
the	1
wild	1
laughter	1
that	1
convulsed	1
his	1
usually	1
impassive	1
features	1

of	1
life	1
here	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
vienna	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
easy	1
but	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
wretched	1
moravian	1
hole	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
difficult	1
and	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1

praise	1
the	1

the	1

bilbin	1
accompanying	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
speak	1
well	1

replied	1
bolknski	1
smiling	1
well	1
talk	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
anyway	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
passion	1
for	1
giving	1
audiences	1
but	1
he	1

not	1
like	1
talking	1

chapter	1
xii	1
at	1
the	1
levee	1
prince	1
andrew	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
austrian	1
officers	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
to	1
and	1
the	1
emperor	1
francis	1
merely	1
looked	1
fixedly	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
just	1
nodded	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
head	1
but	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
adjutant	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
ceremoniously	1
informed	1
bolknski	1
that	1
the	1
emperor	1
desired	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
audience	1
the	1
emperor	1
francis	1
received	1
him	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
the	1
conversation	1
began	1
prince	1
andrew	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
emperor	1
seemed	1
confused	1
and	1
blushed	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
tell	1
me	1
when	1
did	1
the	1
battle	1
begin	1
he	1
asked	1
hurriedly	1
prince	1
andrew	1
replied	1
then	1
followed	1
other	1
questions	1
just	1
as	1
simple	1
was	1
kutzov	1
well	1
when	1
had	1
he	1
left	1
krems	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
the	1
emperor	1
spoke	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
sole	1
aim	1
were	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
given	1
number	1
of	1
questionsthe	1
answers	1
to	1
these	1
questions	1
as	1
was	1
only	1
too	1
evident	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
him	1
at	1
what	1
oclock	1
did	1
the	1
battle	1
begin	1
asked	1
the	1
emperor	1
i	1
cannot	1
inform	1
your	1
majesty	1
at	1
what	1
oclock	1
the	1
battle	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
front	1

at	1
drrenstein	1
where	1
i	1
was	1
our	1
attack	1
began	1
after	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
replied	1
bolknski	1
growing	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
expecting	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
reliable	1
account	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
ready	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
but	1
the	1
emperor	1
smiled	1
and	1
interrupted	1
him	1
how	1
many	1
miles	1
from	1
where	1
to	1
where	1

majesty	1

interrupted	1
him	1
at	1
what	1
oclock	1
was	1
general	1
schmidt	1
killed	1
at	1
seven	1
oclock	1
i	1
believe	1
at	1
seven	1

its	1
very	1
sad	1
very	1
sad	1
the	1
emperor	1
thanked	1
prince	1
andrew	1
and	1
bowed	1
prince	1
andrew	1
withdrew	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
surrounded	1
by	1
courtiers	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
everywhere	1
he	1
saw	1
friendly	1
looks	1
and	1
heard	1
friendly	1
words	1
yesterdays	1
adjutant	1
reproached	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
stayed	1
at	1
the	1
palace	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1

came	1
up	1
and	1
congratulated	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
maria	1
theresa	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
grade	1
which	1
the	1
emperor	1
was	1
conferring	1
on	1
him	1
the	1

chamberlain	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
majesty	1
the	1
archduchess	1
also	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whom	1
to	1
answer	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
collected	1
his	1
thoughts	1
then	1
the	1
russian	1
ambassador	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1

into	1
the	1

on	1
still	1
farther	1

scoundrel	1

again	1
at	1
our	1
heels	1
eh	1

asked	1
prince	1
andrew	1
bilbin	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
his	1
usually	1
calm	1
face	1
showed	1
excitement	1
there	1
now	1
confess	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
delightful	1
said	1
he	1
this	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
thabor	1
bridge	1
at	1
vienna	1
they	1
have	1
crossed	1
without	1
striking	1
a	1
blow	1
prince	1
andrew	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
but	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
come	1
from	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
every	1
coachman	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
knows	1
i	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
archduchess	1
i	1
heard	1
nothing	1
there	1
and	1
you	1
didnt	1
see	1
that	1
everybody	1
is	1
packing	1
up	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
all	1
about	1
inquired	1
prince	1
andrew	1
impatiently	1
whats	1
it	1
all	1
about	1
why	1
the	1
french	1
have	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge	1
that	1
auersperg	1
was	1
defending	1
and	1
the	1
bridge	1
was	1
not	1
blown	1
up	1
so	1
murat	1
is	1
now	1
rushing	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
brnn	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
what	1
here	1
but	1
why	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
blow	1
up	1
the	1
bridge	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
mined	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
i	1
ask	1
you	1
no	1
one	1
not	1
even	1
bonaparte	1
knows	1
why	1
bolknski	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
bridge	1
is	1
crossed	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
too	1
is	1
lost	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
said	1
he	1
thats	1
just	1
it	1
answered	1
bilbin	1
listen	1
the	1
french	1
entered	1
vienna	1
as	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
very	1
well	1
next	1
day	1
which	1
was	1
yesterday	1
those	1
gentlemen	1
messieurs	1
les	1
marchaux	1
murat	1
lannes	1
and	1
belliard	1
mount	1
and	1
ride	1
to	1
the	1
bridge	1
observe	1
that	1
all	1
three	1
are	1
gascons	1
gentlemen	1
says	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
thabor	1
bridge	1
is	1
mined	1
and	1
doubly	1
mined	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
menacing	1
fortifications	1
at	1
its	1
head	1
and	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
men	1
has	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
blow	1
up	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
not	1
let	1
us	1
cross	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
please	1
our	1
sovereign	1
the	1
emperor	1
napoleon	1
if	1
we	1
take	1
this	1
bridge	1
so	1
let	1
us	1
three	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
yes	1
lets	1
say	1
the	1
others	1
and	1
off	1
they	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
bridge	1
cross	1
it	1
and	1
now	1
with	1
their	1
whole	1
army	1
are	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
danube	1
marching	1
on	1
us	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
lines	1
of	1
communication	1
the	1
marshalls	1
stop	1
jesting	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
sadly	1
and	1
seriously	1
this	1
news	1
grieved	1
him	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
russian	1
army	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hopeless	1
situation	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
lead	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
position	1
that	1
here	1
was	1
the	1
toulon	1
that	1
would	1
lift	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
obscure	1
officers	1
and	1
offer	1
him	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
to	1
fame	1
listening	1
to	1
bilbin	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
imagining	1
how	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
army	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
an	1
opinion	1
at	1
the	1
war	1
council	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
that	1
could	1
save	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
alone	1
would	1
be	1
entrusted	1
with	1
the	1
executing	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
stop	1
this	1
jesting	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
jesting	1
bilbin	1
went	1
on	1
nothing	1
is	1
truer	1
or	1
sadder	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
ride	1
onto	1
the	1
bridge	1
alone	1
and	1
wave	1
white	1
handkerchiefs	1
they	1
assure	1
the	1
officer	1
on	1
duty	1
that	1
they	1
the	1
marshals	1
are	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
negotiate	1
with	1
prince	1
auersperg	1
he	1
lets	1
them	1
enter	1
the	1
ttedepont	1
they	1
spin	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
gasconades	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
is	1
over	1
that	1
the	1
emperor	1
francis	1
is	1
arranging	1
a	1
meeting	1
with	1
bonaparte	1
that	1
they	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
prince	1
auersperg	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
the	1
officer	1
sends	1
for	1
auersperg	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
embrace	1
the	1
officers	1
crack	1
jokes	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
cannon	1
and	1
meanwhile	1
a	1
french	1
battalion	1
gets	1
to	1
the	1
bridge	1
unobserved	1
flings	1
the	1
bags	1
of	1
incendiary	1
material	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
approaches	1

in	1
a	1
word	1
those	1
gentlemen	1
gascons	1
indeed	1
so	1
bewildered	1
him	1
with	1
fine	1
words	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
flattered	1
by	1
his	1
rapidly	1
established	1
intimacy	1
with	1
the	1
french	1
marshals	1

in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
animation	1
of	1
his	1
speech	1
bilbin	1
did	1
not	1
forget	1
to	1
pause	1
after	1
this	1
mot	1
to	1
give	1
time	1
for	1
its	1
due	1
appreciation	1
the	1
french	1
battalion	1
rushes	1
to	1
the	1
bridgehead	1
spikes	1
the	1
guns	1
and	1
the	1
bridge	1
is	1
taken	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
excitement	1
subsiding	1
under	1
the	1
delightful	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
story	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
sergeant	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
cannon	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
signal	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1
mines	1
and	1
blow	1
up	1
the	1
bridge	1
this	1
sergeant	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
french	1
troops	1
were	1
running	1
onto	1
the	1
bridge	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
fire	1
but	1
lannes	1
stayed	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
sergeant	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
wiser	1
than	1
his	1
general	1
goes	1
up	1
to	1
auersperg	1
and	1
says	1
prince	1
you	1
are	1
being	1
deceived	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
french	1
murat	1
seeing	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
lost	1
if	1
the	1
sergeant	1
is	1
allowed	1
to	1
speak	1
turns	1
to	1
auersperg	1
with	1
feigned	1
astonishment	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
gascon	1
and	1
says	1
i	1
dont	1
recognize	1
the	1
worldfamous	1
austrian	1
discipline	1
if	1
you	1
allow	1
a	1
subordinate	1
to	1
address	1
you	1
like	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
stroke	1
of	1
genius	1
prince	1
auersperg	1
feels	1
his	1
dignity	1
at	1
stake	1
and	1
orders	1
the	1
sergeant	1
to	1
be	1
arrested	1
come	1
you	1
must	1
own	1
that	1
this	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
thabor	1
bridge	1
is	1
delightful	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
exactly	1
stupidity	1
nor	1
rascality	1
bridgehead	1
that	1
their	1
fire	1
gets	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
he	1
forgets	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
firing	1
at	1
the	1
enemy	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
treachery	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
vividly	1
imagining	1
the	1
gray	1
overcoats	1
wounds	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
gunpowder	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
awaited	1
him	1
not	1
that	1
either	1
that	1
puts	1
the	1
court	1
in	1
too	1
bad	1
a	1
light	1
replied	1
bilbin	1
its	1
not	1
treachery	1
nor	1
rascality	1
nor	1
stupidity	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
at	1

he	1
concluded	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
produced	1
a	1
good	1
epigram	1
a	1
fresh	1
one	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
repeated	1
his	1
hitherto	1
puckered	1
brow	1
became	1
smooth	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
pleasure	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
smile	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
examine	1
his	1
nails	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to	1
he	1
said	1
suddenly	1
to	1
prince	1
andrew	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
toward	1
his	1
room	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
where	1
to	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
but	1
you	1
meant	1
to	1
stay	1
another	1
two	1
days	1
but	1
now	1
i	1
am	1
off	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
prince	1
andrew	1
after	1
giving	1
directions	1
about	1
his	1
departure	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
mon	1
cher	1
said	1
bilbin	1
following	1
him	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
you	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
and	1
in	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
conclusiveness	1
of	1
his	1
opinion	1
all	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
vanished	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
prince	1
andrew	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
gave	1
no	1
reply	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
your	1
duty	1
to	1
gallop	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
i	1
understand	1
that	1
mon	1
cher	1
it	1
is	1
heroism	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
but	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
philosopher	1
be	1
a	1
consistent	1
one	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
duty	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
yourself	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
fit	1
for	1

you	1

not	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
dismissed	1
from	1

was	1
moving	1
with	1
great	1
haste	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
disorder	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
so	1
obstructed	1
with	1
carts	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1

a	1
horse	1
and	1
a	1

from	1

and	1
hungry	1
and	1
weary	1
making	1
his	1
way	1
past	1
the	1
baggage	1
wagons	1
rode	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1

of	1

very	1
sinister	1
reports	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
reached	1
him	1
as	1

went	1
along	1
and	1
the	1

of	1

in	1
their	1

confirmed	1

in	1

address	1
to	1
his	1
army	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1

and	1
they	1
awoke	1
in	1
him	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
his	1
hero	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
wounded	1
pride	1

a	1

with	1
disdain	1
at	1
the	1

again	1

from	1

of	1

feebly	1
heard	1
amid	1

one	1

by	1

up	1

was	1
just	1
putting	1
his	1
question	1
to	1
a	1
soldier	1
when	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
diverted	1
by	1
the	1
desperate	1
shrieks	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
vehicle	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1

out	1
from	1

waving	1
her	1

from	1

this	1
expression	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
nice	1
snub	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
aidedecamp	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
behind	1
prince	1
andrew	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
officer	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
senseless	1
tipsy	1
rage	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
saying	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
championship	1
of	1
the	1
doctors	1
wife	1
in	1
her	1
queer	1
trap	1
might	1
expose	1
him	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
dreaded	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
worldto	1
ridicule	1
but	1
his	1
instinct	1
urged	1
him	1
on	1
before	1
the	1
officer	1
finished	1
his	1
sentence	1
prince	1
andrew	1
his	1
face	1
distorted	1
with	1
fury	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
riding	1
whip	1
kindly	1
letthempass	1
the	1
officer	1
flourished	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
hastily	1
rode	1
away	1
its	1
all	1
the	1
fault	1
of	1
these	1
fellows	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
that	1
theres	1
this	1
disorder	1
he	1
muttered	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
prince	1
andrew	1
without	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyes	1
rode	1
hastily	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
doctors	1
wife	1
who	1
was	1
calling	1
him	1
her	1
deliverer	1
and	1
recalling	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
disgust	1
the	1
minutest	1
details	1
of	1
this	1
humiliating	1
scene	1
he	1
galloped	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
was	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
village	1
he	1
dismounted	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
nearest	1
house	1
intending	1
to	1
rest	1
if	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
eat	1
something	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
sort	1
out	1
the	1
stinging	1
and	1
tormenting	1
thoughts	1
that	1
confused	1
his	1
mind	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
mob	1
of	1
scoundrels	1
and	1
not	1
an	1
army	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
house	1
when	1
a	1
familiar	1
voice	1
called	1
him	1
by	1
name	1
he	1
turned	1
round	1
nesvtskis	1
handsome	1
face	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
window	1
nesvtski	1
moving	1
his	1
moist	1
lips	1
as	1
he	1
chewed	1
something	1
and	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm	1
called	1
him	1
to	1
enter	1
bolknski	1
bolknski	1

nesvtski	1
and	1
another	1
adjutant	1
having	1
something	1
to	1
eat	1
they	1
hastily	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
him	1
asking	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
news	1
on	1
their	1
familiar	1
faces	1
he	1
read	1
agitation	1
and	1
alarm	1
this	1
was	1
particularly	1
noticeable	1
on	1
nesvtskis	1
usually	1
laughing	1
countenance	1
where	1

the	1
commander	1
in	1

said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1

was	1
passing	1
by	1
kutzovs	1
carriage	1
and	1
the	1
exhausted	1

of	1
his	1

with	1
their	1

were	1
talking	1
loudly	1
together	1

the	1

glancing	1
angrily	1
and	1
disrespectfully	1
at	1
kozlvski	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
kutzovs	1
voice	1
excited	1
and	1
dissatisfied	1
interrupted	1
by	1
another	1
an	1
unfamiliar	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
these	1
voices	1
the	1
inattentive	1
way	1
kozlvski	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
the	1
disrespectful	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
exhausted	1

the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1

squatting	1
on	1
the	1

by	1
a	1

so	1
near	1
to	1

felt	1
that	1

disastrous	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
happen	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
kozlvski	1
with	1
urgent	1
questions	1
immediately	1

dispositions	1

issued	1
for	1

prince	1
andrew	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1

from	1
whence	1
voices	1
were	1
heard	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
open	1
it	1
the	1
sounds	1
ceased	1
the	1

opened	1

kutzov	1
with	1
his	1

appeared	1
in	1

the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chiefs	1
one	1
sound	1
eye	1
showed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
preoccupied	1
with	1
thoughts	1
and	1
anxieties	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
oblivious	1
of	1
his	1

he	1
looked	1
straight	1
at	1
his	1
adjutants	1
face	1
without	1
recognizing	1
him	1

you	1

his	1

suddenly	1
softened	1
and	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
he	1
drew	1
bagratin	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1

he	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1

over	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
evidently	1
habitual	1
offering	1
his	1
puffy	1
cheek	1

bagratin	1
kissed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
neck	1

in	1
silence	1
there	1
is	1
still	1

before	1

prince	1
andrew	1
glanced	1
at	1
kutzovs	1
face	1
only	1
a	1
foot	1
distant	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
noticed	1
the	1
carefully	1
washed	1
seams	1
of	1
the	1
scar	1
near	1
his	1
temple	1
where	1
an	1

has	1
a	1
right	1

beg	1
to	1

sent	1
to	1
that	1
detachment	1
he	1
said	1
kutzov	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
forgotten	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
saying	1
and	1
sat	1
plunged	1
in	1
thought	1
five	1
minutes	1
later	1
gently	1
swaying	1
on	1
the	1
soft	1
springs	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
prince	1
andrew	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
trace	1
of	1
agitation	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
delicate	1
irony	1
he	1
questioned	1
prince	1
andrew	1
about	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
the	1
emperor	1
about	1
the	1
remarks	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
at	1
court	1
concerning	1
the	1
krems	1

and	1
about	1
some	1
ladies	1
they	1
both	1
knew	1
chapter	1

on	1
november	1
kutzov	1
had	1
received	1
through	1
a	1
spy	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
he	1
commanded	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
almost	1
hopeless	1
position	1
the	1
spy	1
reported	1
that	1
the	1
french	1
after	1
crossing	1
the	1
bridge	1
at	1
vienna	1
were	1
advancing	1
in	1
immense	1
force	1
upon	1
kutzovs	1
line	1
of	1
communication	1
with	1
the	1
troops	1
that	1
were	1
arriving	1
from	1
russia	1
if	1

decided	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
krems	1
napoleons	1
army	1
of	1
one	1
hundred	1

fifty	1
thousand	1

cut	1
him	1
off	1
completely	1
and	1
surround	1
his	1
exhausted	1
army	1
of	1
forty	1
thousand	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
mack	1
at	1
ulm	1
if	1
kutzov	1
decided	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
road	1
connecting	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
troops	1
arriving	1
from	1

he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
march	1
with	1
no	1
road	1
into	1
unknown	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
bohemian	1
mountains	1
defending	1
himself	1
against	1
superior	1
forces	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
abandoning	1
all	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
junction	1
with	1
buxhwden	1
if	1
kutzov	1
decided	1
to	1
retreat	1
along	1
the	1

from	1
krems	1
to	1
olmtz	1
to	1
unite	1
with	1
the	1
troops	1
arriving	1
from	1
russia	1
he	1
risked	1
being	1
forestalled	1
on	1
that	1
road	1
by	1
the	1
french	1
who	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
vienna	1

encumbered	1
by	1

to	1
accept	1

on	1
the	1
march	1
against	1
an	1
enemy	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
strong	1
who	1
would	1
hem	1
him	1
in	1
from	1
two	1

chose	1
this	1

if	1
he	1
reached	1

before	1

would	1
be	1

hope	1
of	1
saving	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
french	1
forestall	1
him	1
at	1

the	1
exposure	1
of	1
his	1
whole	1

to	1
a	1
disgrace	1
such	1
as	1
that	1
of	1

to	1
utter	1
destruction	1
but	1
to	1
forestall	1
the	1
french	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
army	1
was	1
impossible	1
the	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
french	1
from	1
vienna	1
to	1
znaim	1
was	1
shorter	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
the	1

for	1
the	1
russians	1
from	1

to	1

the	1
night	1

to	1
halt	1
facing	1
vienna	1
with	1

to	1
his	1

if	1
he	1

in	1

was	1
to	1
delay	1
them	1

long	1
as	1
possible	1
kutzov	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1

took	1
the	1

to	1

marching	1
thirty	1

that	1
stormy	1
night	1
across	1

kutzov	1
with	1

had	1
still	1
to	1
march	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
before	1

could	1
reach	1
znaim	1
hence	1
bagratin	1
with	1
his	1
four	1
thousand	1
hungry	1
exhausted	1
men	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
detain	1
for	1
days	1
the	1
whole	1
enemy	1
army	1
that	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
at	1
hollabrnn	1
which	1
was	1
clearly	1
impossible	1
but	1
a	1
freak	1
of	1
fate	1
made	1
the	1
impossible	1
possible	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
trick	1
that	1
had	1
placed	1
the	1
vienna	1
bridge	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1

without	1

in	1
a	1
similar	1
way	1
meeting	1

on	1

be	1
able	1
to	1
crush	1

the	1

of	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
who	1
were	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
from	1

with	1
this	1
object	1
offered	1
a	1
three	1

on	1
condition	1
that	1
both	1

should	1
remain	1
in	1

declared	1
that	1

to	1
offer	1
the	1

that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
authorized	1
either	1
to	1

refuse	1
a	1

sent	1

adjutant	1
to	1
kutzov	1
to	1
report	1
the	1
offer	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
a	1

was	1
kutzovs	1
sole	1
chance	1
of	1
gaining	1
time	1
giving	1

some	1
rest	1

of	1

the	1
only	1
and	1
a	1
quite	1
unexpected	1
chance	1
of	1
saving	1
the	1
army	1
on	1
receiving	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
immediately	1
dispatched	1

who	1
was	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
the	1

wintzingerode	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
the	1
truce	1

also	1
to	1
offer	1
terms	1
of	1
capitulation	1
and	1
meanwhile	1
kutzov	1
sent	1
his	1
adjutants	1
back	1
to	1
hasten	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
the	1

this	1

of	1
the	1

to	1

stationary	1
in	1

of	1
an	1
enemy	1
eight	1
times	1
as	1
strong	1

that	1
the	1

might	1
give	1

for	1

that	1

weary	1
faces	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking	1
now	1
what	1
does	1
this	1
mean	1
gentlemen	1
said	1
the	1

officer	1
in	1
the	1
reproachful	1
tone	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
repeated	1
the	1

thing	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
wont	1
do	1
to	1
leave	1
your	1
posts	1
like	1
this	1
the	1
prince	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
leave	1
his	1
post	1
now	1
you	1
captain	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
a	1
thin	1
dirty	1
little	1
artillery	1
officer	1
who	1
without	1
his	1
boots	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
the	1

keeper	1
to	1
dry	1
in	1
only	1
his	1
stockings	1
rose	1
when	1
they	1
entered	1
smiling	1
not	1
altogether	1
comfortably	1
well	1
arent	1
you	1
ashamed	1
of	1
yourself	1
captain	1
tshin	1
he	1
continued	1
one	1
would	1
think	1
that	1
as	1
an	1
artillery	1
officer	1
you	1
would	1
set	1
a	1
good	1
example	1
yet	1
here	1
you	1
are	1
without	1
your	1
boots	1
the	1
alarm	1
will	1
be	1
sounded	1
and	1
youll	1
be	1
in	1

without	1

smiled	1
kindly	1

in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
command	1
prince	1
andrew	1
smiled	1
involuntarily	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1

who	1
silent	1
and	1
smiling	1
shifting	1
from	1
one	1
stockinged	1
foot	1
to	1
the	1

glanced	1
inquiringly	1
with	1
his	1
large	1

kindly	1
eyes	1
from	1

andrew	1
to	1
the	1

the	1

say	1
it	1
feels	1
easier	1
without	1

said	1
captain	1
tshin	1
smiling	1
shyly	1
in	1
his	1
uncomfortable	1
position	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
adopt	1
a	1
jocular	1
tone	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
jest	1
was	1
unacceptable	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
off	1
he	1
grew	1
confused	1
kindly	1

was	1
something	1
peculiar	1
about	1

quite	1
unsoldierly	1
rather	1
comic	1

extremely	1
attractive	1
the	1

despite	1
the	1

upon	1
some	1
dozens	1
of	1

from	1

unnaturally	1
a	1

pacing	1
up	1

down	1
the	1

kept	1
repeating	1
its	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
a	1

steal	1
a	1

expression	1
on	1

stepped	1
away	1
from	1

at	1

stopped	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
dlokhov	1

come	1
from	1
the	1

bending	1

not	1

a	1

dlokhov	1

answer	1
the	1

he	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
into	1
a	1
hot	1
dispute	1
with	1
the	1
french	1
grenadier	1
they	1
were	1
naturally	1
talking	1
about	1
the	1
campaign	1
the	1
frenchman	1
confusing	1
the	1
austrians	1
with	1
the	1
russians	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
russians	1
had	1
surrendered	1
and	1
had	1
fled	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
from	1

maintained	1
that	1

not	1

had	1
beaten	1
the	1

we	1

came	1
peals	1
of	1
such	1
healthy	1
and	1
goodhumored	1
laughter	1
from	1
the	1
soldiers	1
that	1
it	1
infected	1
the	1
french	1
involuntarily	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
left	1
to	1
do	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
to	1
unload	1
the	1
muskets	1
explode	1
the	1
ammunition	1
and	1
all	1
return	1
home	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
but	1
the	1
guns	1
remained	1
loaded	1
the	1
loopholes	1
in	1
blockhouses	1
and	1
entrenchments	1
looked	1
out	1
just	1
as	1
menacingly	1
and	1
the	1
unlimbered	1
cannon	1
confronted	1
one	1
another	1
as	1

prince	1
andrew	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
battery	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
field	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
here	1
he	1
dismounted	1
and	1
stopped	1
beside	1
the	1
farthest	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
unlimbered	1
cannon	1
before	1
the	1
guns	1
an	1
artillery	1
sentry	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
he	1
stood	1
at	1
attention	1
when	1
the	1
officer	1
arrived	1
but	1
at	1
a	1
sign	1
resumed	1
his	1
measured	1
monotonous	1
pacing	1
behind	1
the	1
guns	1
were	1
their	1
limbers	1
and	1
still	1
farther	1
back	1
picket	1
ropes	1
and	1
artillerymens	1
bonfires	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
farthest	1
cannon	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
newly	1
constructed	1
wattle	1
shed	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
officers	1
voices	1
in	1
eager	1
conversation	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
that	1
a	1
view	1
over	1
nearly	1
the	1
whole	1
russian	1
position	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
enemys	1
opened	1
out	1
from	1
this	1
battery	1
just	1
facing	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
crest	1
of	1
the	1
opposite	1
hill	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
schn	1
grabern	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
and	1
in	1
three	1
places	1
to	1
left	1
and	1
right	1
the	1
french	1
troops	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
their	1
campfires	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
evidently	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
itself	1
and	1
behind	1
the	1
hill	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
from	1
that	1
village	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke	1
was	1
something	1
resembling	1
a	1
battery	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
clearly	1
with	1
the	1
naked	1
eye	1
our	1
right	1
flank	1
was	1
posted	1
on	1
a	1
rather	1
steep	1
incline	1
which	1
dominated	1
the	1
french	1
position	1
our	1
infantry	1
were	1
stationed	1
there	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
farthest	1
point	1
the	1
dragoons	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
where	1
tshins	1
battery	1
stood	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
prince	1
andrew	1
was	1
surveying	1
the	1
position	1
was	1
the	1
easiest	1
and	1
most	1
direct	1
descent	1
and	1
ascent	1
to	1
the	1
brook	1
separating	1
us	1
from	1
schn	1
grabern	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
our	1
troops	1
were	1
close	1
to	1
a	1
copse	1
in	1
which	1
smoked	1
the	1
bonfires	1
of	1
our	1
infantry	1
who	1
were	1
felling	1
wood	1
the	1
french	1
line	1
was	1
wider	1
than	1
ours	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
easily	1
outflank	1
us	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
behind	1
our	1
position	1
was	1
a	1
steep	1
and	1
deep	1
dip	1
making	1
it	1
difficult	1
for	1
artillery	1
and	1
cavalry	1
to	1
retire	1
prince	1
andrew	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
notebook	1
and	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
cannon	1
sketched	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
he	1
made	1
some	1
notes	1
on	1
two	1
points	1
intending	1
to	1
mention	1
them	1
to	1
bagratin	1
his	1
idea	1
was	1
first	1
to	1
concentrate	1
all	1
the	1
artillery	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
and	1
secondly	1
to	1
withdraw	1
the	1
cavalry	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
dip	1
prince	1
andrew	1
being	1
always	1
near	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
closely	1
following	1
the	1
mass	1
movements	1
and	1
general	1
orders	1
and	1
constantly	1
studying	1
historical	1
accounts	1
of	1
battles	1
involuntarily	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
in	1
the	1
forthcoming	1
action	1
in	1
broad	1
outline	1
he	1
imagined	1
only	1
important	1
possibilities	1
if	1
the	1
enemy	1
attacks	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
kiev	1
grenadiers	1
and	1
the	1
podlsk	1
chasseurs	1
must	1
hold	1
their	1
position	1
till	1
reserves	1
from	1
the	1
center	1
come	1
up	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
the	1
dragoons	1
could	1
successfully	1
make	1
a	1
flank	1
counterattack	1
if	1
they	1
attack	1
our	1
center	1
we	1
having	1
the	1
center	1
battery	1
on	1
this	1
high	1
ground	1
shall	1
withdraw	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
under	1
its	1
cover	1
and	1
retreat	1
to	1
the	1
dip	1
by	1
echelons	1
so	1
he	1
reasoned	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
beside	1
the	1
gun	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
distinctly	1
but	1
as	1
often	1
happens	1
had	1
not	1
understood	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying	1
suddenly	1
however	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
voice	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
shed	1
and	1
its	1
tone	1
was	1
so	1
sincere	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
listen	1
no	1
friend	1
said	1
a	1
pleasant	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
prince	1
andrew	1
a	1
familiar	1
voice	1
what	1
i	1
say	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
beyond	1
death	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
would	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
it	1
thats	1
so	1
friend	1
another	1
a	1
younger	1
voice	1
interrupted	1
him	1
afraid	1
or	1
not	1
you	1
cant	1
escape	1
it	1
anyhow	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
one	1
is	1
afraid	1
oh	1
you	1
clever	1
people	1
said	1
a	1
third	1
manly	1
voice	1
interrupting	1
them	1
both	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
artillery	1
men	1
are	1
very	1
wise	1
because	1
you	1
can	1
take	1
everything	1
along	1
with	1
youvodka	1
and	1
snacks	1
and	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
manly	1
voice	1
evidently	1
an	1
infantry	1
officer	1
laughed	1
yes	1
one	1
is	1
afraid	1
continued	1
the	1
first	1
speaker	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
familiar	1
voice	1
one	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
unknown	1
thats	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
whatever	1
we	1
may	1
say	1
about	1
the	1
soul	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
sky	1
we	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
sky	1
but	1
only	1
an	1
atmosphere	1
the	1
manly	1
voice	1
again	1
interrupted	1
the	1
artillery	1
officer	1
well	1
stand	1
us	1
some	1
of	1
your	1
herb	1
vodka	1
tshin	1
it	1
said	1
why	1
thought	1
prince	1
andrew	1
thats	1
the	1
captain	1
who	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
sutlers	1
hut	1
without	1
his	1
boots	1
he	1
recognized	1
the	1
agreeable	1
philosophizing	1
voice	1
with	1
pleasure	1
some	1
herb	1
vodka	1
certainly	1
said	1
tshin	1
but	1
still	1
to	1
conceive	1
a	1
future	1
life	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
just	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
whistle	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
faster	1
and	1
louder	1
louder	1
and	1
faster	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
finished	1
saying	1
what	1
was	1
necessary	1
thudded	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
near	1
the	1
shed	1
with	1
super	1
human	1
force	1
throwing	1
up	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
earth	1
the	1
ground	1
seemed	1
to	1
groan	1
at	1
the	1
terrible	1
impact	1
and	1
immediately	1
tshin	1
with	1
a	1
short	1
pipe	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
his	1
kind	1
intelligent	1
face	1
rather	1
pale	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
manly	1
voice	1
a	1
dashing	1
infantry	1
officer	1
who	1
hurried	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
company	1
buttoning	1
up	1
his	1
coat	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
chapter	1
xvii	1
mounting	1
his	1
horse	1
again	1
prince	1
andrew	1
lingered	1
with	1
the	1
battery	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
puff	1
from	1
the	1
gun	1
that	1
had	1
sent	1
the	1
ball	1
his	1
eyes	1
ran	1
rapidly	1
over	1
the	1
wide	1
space	1
but	1
he	1
only	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
hitherto	1
motionless	1
masses	1
of	1
the	1
french	1
now	1
swayed	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
really	1
was	1
a	1
battery	1
to	1
their	1
left	1
the	1
smoke	1
above	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
dispersed	1
two	1
mounted	1
frenchmen	1
probably	1
adjutants	1
were	1
galloping	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
a	1
small	1
but	1
distinctly	1
visible	1
enemy	1
column	1
was	1
moving	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
probably	1
to	1
strengthen	1
the	1
front	1
line	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
shot	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
dispersed	1
before	1
another	1
puff	1
appeared	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
report	1
the	1
battle	1
had	1
begun	1
prince	1
andrew	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
galloped	1
back	1
to	1
grunth	1
to	1
find	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
cannonade	1
behind	1
him	1
growing	1
louder	1
and	1
more	1
frequent	1
evidently	1
our	1
guns	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
reply	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
slope	1
where	1
the	1
parleys	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
came	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
musketry	1
lemarrois	1
had	1
just	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
with	1
bonapartes	1
stern	1
letter	1
and	1
murat	1
humiliated	1
and	1
anxious	1
to	1
expiate	1
his	1
fault	1
had	1
at	1
once	1
moved	1
his	1
forces	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
center	1
and	1
outflank	1
both	1
the	1
russian	1
wings	1
hoping	1
before	1
evening	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
emperor	1
to	1
crush	1
the	1
contemptible	1
detachment	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
him	1
it	1
has	1
begun	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
thought	1
prince	1
andrew	1
feeling	1
the	1
blood	1
rush	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
but	1
where	1
and	1
how	1
will	1
my	1
toulon	1
present	1
itself	1
passing	1
between	1
the	1
companies	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
eating	1
porridge	1
and	1
drinking	1
vodka	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
he	1
saw	1
everywhere	1
the	1
same	1
rapid	1
movement	1
of	1
soldiers	1
forming	1
ranks	1
and	1
getting	1
their	1
muskets	1
ready	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
their	1
faces	1
he	1
recognized	1
the	1
same	1
eagerness	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
heart	1
it	1
has	1
begun	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
dreadful	1
but	1
enjoyable	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
each	1
soldier	1
and	1
each	1
officer	1
seemed	1
to	1

waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1

up	1

reined	1
in	1
his	1

and	1
recognizing	1
prince	1
andrew	1
nodded	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
still	1
looked	1
ahead	1
while	1
prince	1
andrew	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
feeling	1
it	1
has	1
begun	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
was	1
seen	1
even	1
on	1
prince	1
bagratins	1
hard	1
brown	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
halfclosed	1
dull	1
sleepy	1
eyes	1
prince	1
andrew	1
gazed	1
with	1
anxious	1
curiosity	1
at	1
that	1
impassive	1

wished	1
he	1
could	1
tell	1
what	1
if	1
anything	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
thinking	1
and	1
feeling	1
at	1

anything	1
at	1

behind	1

andrew	1
asked	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
sign	1
of	1
agreement	1
with	1
what	1
prince	1
andrew	1
told	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
very	1
good	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
imply	1
that	1
everything	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
and	1
was	1
reported	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
foreseen	1
prince	1
andrew	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
with	1
his	1
rapid	1
ride	1
spoke	1
quickly	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
uttering	1
his	1
words	1
with	1
an	1
oriental	1
accent	1
spoke	1
particularly	1
slowly	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
impress	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
hurry	1
however	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
a	1
trot	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
tshins	1
battery	1
prince	1
andrew	1
followed	1
with	1
the	1
suite	1
behind	1

rode	1
an	1

of	1
the	1

officer	1
on	1
duty	1
riding	1
a	1
fine	1
bobtailed	1
horse	1
and	1
a	1
civilianan	1
accountant	1
who	1
had	1
asked	1
permission	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
out	1
of	1
curiosity	1
the	1
accountant	1
a	1
stout	1
fullfaced	1
man	1
looked	1
around	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
nave	1
smile	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
presented	1
a	1
strange	1
appearance	1
among	1
the	1
hussars	1
cossacks	1
and	1
adjutants	1
in	1
his	1
camlet	1
coat	1
as	1
he	1
jolted	1
on	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
a	1
convoy	1
officers	1
saddle	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
battle	1
said	1
zherkv	1
to	1
bolknski	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
accountant	1
but	1
he	1
feels	1
a	1
pain	1
in	1
the	1
pit	1
of	1
his	1
stomach	1
already	1
oh	1
leave	1
off	1
said	1
the	1
accountant	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
but	1
rather	1
cunning	1
smile	1
as	1
if	1
flattered	1
at	1
being	1
made	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
zherkvs	1
joke	1
and	1
purposely	1
trying	1
to	1
appear	1
stupider	1
than	1
he	1
really	1
was	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
strange	1
mon	1
monsieur	1
prince	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
in	1
french	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
peculiar	1
way	1
of	1
addressing	1
a	1
prince	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
it	1
quite	1
right	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
approaching	1
tshins	1
battery	1
and	1
a	1
ball	1
struck	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
whats	1
that	1
that	1
has	1
fallen	1
asked	1
the	1
accountant	1
with	1
a	1
nave	1
smile	1
a	1
french	1
pancake	1
answered	1
zherkv	1
so	1
thats	1
what	1
they	1
hit	1
with	1
asked	1
the	1
accountant	1
how	1
awful	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
swell	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
finished	1
speaking	1
when	1
they	1
again	1
heard	1
an	1
unexpectedly	1
violent	1
whistling	1
which	1
suddenly	1
ended	1
with	1
a	1
thud	1
into	1
something	1
soft	1
ffflop	1
and	1
a	1
cossack	1
riding	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
their	1
right	1
and	1
behind	1
the	1
accountant	1
crashed	1
to	1
earth	1
with	1
his	1
horse	1
zherkv	1
and	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
bent	1
over	1
their	1
saddles	1
and	1
turned	1
their	1
horses	1
away	1
the	1
accountant	1
stopped	1
facing	1
the	1
cossack	1
and	1
examined	1
him	1
with	1
attentive	1
curiosity	1
the	1
cossack	1
was	1
dead	1
but	1
the	1
horse	1
still	1
struggled	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
confusion	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
indifference	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say	1
is	1
it	1
worth	1
while	1
noticing	1
trifles	1
he	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
a	1
skillful	1
rider	1
and	1
slightly	1
bending	1
over	1
disengaged	1
his	1
saber	1
which	1
had	1
caught	1
in	1
his	1
cloak	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
oldfashioned	1
saber	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
general	1
use	1
prince	1
andrew	1
remembered	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
suvrov	1
giving	1
his	1
saber	1
to	1
bagratin	1
in	1
italy	1
and	1
the	1
recollection	1
was	1
particularly	1
pleasant	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
they	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
battery	1
at	1
which	1
prince	1
andrew	1
had	1
been	1
when	1
he	1
examined	1
the	1
battlefield	1
whose	1
company	1
asked	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
of	1
an	1
artilleryman	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
ammunition	1
wagon	1
he	1
asked	1
whose	1
company	1
but	1
he	1
really	1
meant	1
are	1
you	1
frightened	1
here	1
and	1
the	1
artilleryman	1
understood	1
him	1
captain	1
tshins	1
your	1
excellency	1
shouted	1
the	1
redhaired	1
freckled	1
gunner	1
in	1
a	1
merry	1
voice	1
standing	1
to	1
attention	1
yes	1
yes	1
muttered	1
bagratin	1
as	1
if	1
considering	1
something	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
past	1
the	1
limbers	1
to	1
the	1
farthest	1
cannon	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
a	1
ringing	1
shot	1
issued	1
from	1
it	1
deafening	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
suite	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
smoke	1
that	1
suddenly	1
surrounded	1
the	1
gun	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
gunners	1
who	1
had	1
seized	1
it	1
straining	1
to	1
roll	1
it	1
quickly	1
back	1

one	1
holding	1
a	1
mop	1
his	1
legs	1
far	1
apart	1
sprang	1
to	1
the	1
wheel	1
while	1

with	1
a	1

placed	1
a	1

stumbling	1
over	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
the	1

moved	1
forward	1
and	1
not	1
noticing	1
the	1
general	1
looked	1
out	1
shading	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
small	1
hand	1
lift	1
it	1
two	1
lines	1
more	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
just	1
right	1
cried	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
feeble	1
voice	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
impart	1
a	1
dashing	1
note	1
illsuited	1
to	1
his	1
weak	1
figure	1

squeaked	1

raising	1
three	1

to	1
his	1

with	1
a	1
bashful	1
and	1
awkward	1
gesture	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
a	1

like	1

had	1
been	1

no	1

for	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
great	1
respect	1

be	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
to	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
very	1
good	1
said	1
bagratin	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
officers	1
report	1
and	1
began	1
deliberately	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
whole	1
battlefield	1
extended	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
french	1
had	1
advanced	1
nearest	1
on	1
our	1
right	1
below	1
the	1
height	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
kiev	1
regiment	1
was	1
stationed	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
where	1
the	1
rivulet	1
flowed	1
the	1
soulstirring	1
rolling	1
and	1
crackling	1
of	1
musketry	1
was	1
heard	1
and	1
much	1
farther	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
beyond	1
the	1
dragoons	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
bagratin	1
a	1
french	1
column	1
that	1
was	1
outflanking	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
the	1
horizon	1
bounded	1
by	1
the	1
adjacent	1
wood	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
ordered	1
two	1
battalions	1
from	1
the	1
center	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
reinforce	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
ventured	1
to	1
remark	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
if	1
these	1
battalions	1
went	1
away	1
the	1
guns	1
would	1
remain	1
without	1
support	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
dull	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
prince	1
andrew	1
that	1
the	1
officers	1
remark	1
was	1
just	1
and	1
that	1
really	1
no	1
answer	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
it	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
an	1
adjutant	1
galloped	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
and	1
news	1
that	1
immense	1
masses	1
of	1
the	1
french	1
were	1
coming	1
down	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
regiment	1
was	1
in	1
disorder	1
and	1
was	1
retreating	1
upon	1
the	1
kiev	1
grenadiers	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
sign	1
of	1
assent	1
and	1
approval	1
he	1
rode	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
sent	1
an	1
adjutant	1
to	1
the	1
dragoons	1
with	1
orders	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
french	1
but	1
this	1
adjutant	1
returned	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
dragoons	1
had	1
already	1
retreated	1
beyond	1
the	1
dip	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
as	1
a	1
heavy	1
fire	1
had	1
been	1
opened	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
losing	1
men	1
uselessly	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
hastened	1
to	1

having	1
reached	1
the	1
highest	1

began	1
riding	1
downhill	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
musketry	1
was	1
heard	1

where	1
on	1

at	1

exactly	1
what	1
he	1

desired	1

resolution	1

turned	1
to	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
entreating	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
dangerous	1
to	1
remain	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
please	1
your	1
excellency	1
for	1

he	1
kept	1
saying	1
glancing	1
for	1
support	1
at	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
who	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
there	1
you	1
see	1

he	1
drew	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
bullets	1
whistling	1
singing	1
and	1
hissing	1
continually	1
around	1
them	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
entreaty	1
and	1
reproach	1
that	1
a	1

uses	1

you	1

will	1
blister	1

he	1
spoke	1
as	1
if	1
those	1
bullets	1
could	1
not	1
kill	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
halfclosed	1

gave	1
still	1

persuasiveness	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
the	1

joined	1
in	1
the	1

appeals	1
but	1
bagratin	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
he	1
only	1
gave	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
cease	1
firing	1
and	1
reform	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
approaching	1

as	1
a	1
challenge	1
to	1
his	1

the	1

expanded	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
rode	1
frowning	1
beside	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
line	1
as	1
if	1
their	1
differences	1
would	1
be	1
settled	1
there	1
amongst	1
the	1
bullets	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
front	1
several	1
bullets	1
sped	1
over	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
halted	1
in	1
silence	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
fresh	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
line	1
for	1
from	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
evident	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
cavalry	1
to	1
act	1
among	1
the	1
bushes	1
and	1
broken	1
ground	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
that	1
the	1
french	1
were	1
outflanking	1
our	1
left	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
colonel	1
looked	1
sternly	1
and	1
significantly	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
like	1
two	1
fighting	1
cocks	1
preparing	1
for	1
battle	1
each	1
vainly	1
trying	1
to	1
detect	1
signs	1
of	1
cowardice	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
both	1
passed	1
the	1
examination	1
successfully	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
and	1
neither	1
wished	1
to	1
give	1
occasion	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
alleged	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
fire	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
testing	1
each	1
others	1
courage	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
that	1
just	1
then	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
musketry	1
and	1
a	1
muffled	1
shout	1
almost	1
behind	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
the	1
french	1
had	1
attacked	1
the	1
men	1
collecting	1
wood	1
in	1
the	1
copse	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
possible	1
for	1
the	1
hussars	1
to	1
retreat	1
with	1
the	1
infantry	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
line	1
of	1

on	1
the	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
french	1
however	1
inconvenient	1
the	1
position	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
necessary	1
to	1
attack	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
cut	1
a	1
way	1
through	1
for	1
themselves	1
the	1
squadron	1
in	1
which	1
rostv	1
was	1
serving	1
had	1
scarcely	1
time	1
to	1
mount	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
halted	1
facing	1
the	1
enemy	1
again	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
enns	1
bridge	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
between	1
the	1
squadron	1
and	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
again	1
that	1
terrible	1
dividing	1
line	1
of	1
uncertainty	1
and	1
fearresembling	1
the	1
line	1
separating	1
the	1
living	1
from	1
the	1
deadlay	1
between	1
them	1
all	1
were	1
conscious	1
of	1
this	1
unseen	1
line	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
they	1
would	1
cross	1
it	1
or	1
not	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
cross	1
it	1
agitated	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
colonel	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
angrily	1
gave	1
some	1
reply	1
to	1
questions	1
put	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
desperately	1
insisting	1
on	1
having	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
gave	1
an	1
order	1
no	1
one	1
said	1
anything	1
definite	1
but	1
the	1
rumor	1
of	1
an	1
attack	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
squadron	1
the	1
command	1
to	1
form	1
up	1
rang	1
out	1
and	1
the	1
sabers	1
whizzed	1

from	1

scabbards	1
still	1
no	1
one	1
moved	1
the	1
troops	1
of	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
infantry	1
and	1
hussars	1
alike	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
this	1
irresolution	1
communicated	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
if	1
only	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
quick	1
thought	1
rostv	1
feeling	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
experience	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
an	1
attack	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1

at	1

and	1
started	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
before	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
rostv	1
saw	1
the	1
front	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
hussars	1
and	1
still	1
farther	1
ahead	1
a	1
dark	1
line	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
distinctly	1
but	1
took	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
enemy	1
shots	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
but	1
some	1
way	1
off	1
faster	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
and	1
rostv	1
felt	1
rooks	1
flanks	1
drooping	1
as	1
he	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
gallop	1
rostv	1
anticipated	1
his	1
horses	1
movements	1
and	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
elated	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
a	1
solitary	1
tree	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
this	1
tree	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
so	1
terribleand	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
crossed	1
that	1
line	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
there	1
nothing	1
terrible	1
but	1
everything	1
was	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
happy	1
and	1
animated	1
oh	1
how	1
i	1
will	1
slash	1
at	1
him	1
thought	1
rostv	1
gripping	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
his	1
saber	1
huraaaah	1
came	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
voices	1
let	1
anyone	1
come	1
my	1
way	1
now	1
thought	1
rostv	1
driving	1
his	1
spurs	1
into	1
rook	1
and	1
letting	1
him	1
go	1
at	1
a	1
full	1
gallop	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
outstripped	1
the	1
others	1
ahead	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
already	1
visible	1
suddenly	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
birch	1
broom	1
seemed	1
to	1
sweep	1
over	1
the	1
squadron	1
rostv	1
raised	1
his	1
saber	1
ready	1
to	1
strike	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
trooper	1
niktenko	1
who	1
was	1
galloping	1
ahead	1
shot	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
rostv	1
felt	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
that	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
forward	1
with	1
unnatural	1
speed	1
but	1
yet	1
stayed	1
on	1
the	1

spot	1
from	1
behind	1
him	1
bondarchk	1
an	1
hussar	1
he	1

jolted	1
against	1
him	1

looked	1
angrily	1
at	1

is	1
it	1
i	1

not	1
moving	1
i	1
have	1
fallen	1
i	1
am	1
killed	1
rostv	1
asked	1
and	1
answered	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
he	1
was	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
field	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
moving	1
horses	1
and	1
hussars	1
backs	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing	1
before	1
him	1
but	1
the	1
motionless	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
stubble	1
around	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
warm	1
blood	1
under	1
his	1
arm	1
no	1
i	1
am	1
wounded	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
is	1
killed	1
rook	1
tried	1
to	1
rise	1
on	1
his	1
forelegs	1
but	1
fell	1
back	1
pinning	1
his	1
riders	1
leg	1
blood	1
was	1
flowing	1
from	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
struggled	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
rise	1
rostv	1
also	1
tried	1
to	1
rise	1
but	1
fell	1
back	1
his	1
sabretache	1
having	1
become	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
where	1
our	1
men	1
were	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
french	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
near	1
having	1
disentangled	1
his	1
leg	1
he	1
rose	1
where	1
on	1
which	1
side	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
line	1
that	1
had	1
so	1
sharply	1
divided	1
the	1
two	1
armies	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
can	1
something	1
bad	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
wondered	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
superfluous	1
was	1
hanging	1
on	1
his	1
benumbed	1
left	1
arm	1
the	1
wrist	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
his	1
he	1
examined	1
his	1
hand	1
carefully	1
vainly	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
blood	1
on	1
it	1
ah	1
here	1
are	1
people	1
coming	1
he	1
thought	1
joyfully	1
seeing	1
some	1
men	1
running	1
toward	1
him	1
they	1
will	1
help	1
me	1
in	1
front	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
wearing	1
a	1
strange	1
shako	1
and	1
a	1
blue	1
cloak	1
swarthy	1
sunburned	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
hooked	1
nose	1
then	1
came	1
two	1
more	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
running	1
behind	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
said	1
something	1
strange	1
not	1
in	1
russian	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
hindmost	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
wearing	1
similar	1
shakos	1
was	1
a	1
russian	1
hussar	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
arms	1
and	1
his	1

was	1
being	1
led	1
behind	1
him	1
it	1
must	1

looked	1
at	1

approaching	1

though	1

a	1
moment	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
galloping	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
hack	1
them	1
to	1
pieces	1
their	1
proximity	1
now	1
seemed	1
so	1
awful	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1

me	1
whom	1
everyone	1

his	1

his	1

impossible	1

perhaps	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
seconds	1
he	1
stood	1

moving	1
from	1

the	1

frenchman	1
the	1

with	1
the	1

was	1
already	1
so	1
close	1
that	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
and	1
the	1
excited	1
alien	1
face	1
of	1
that	1
man	1
his	1
bayonet	1
hanging	1
down	1
holding	1
his	1
breath	1
and	1
running	1
so	1
lightly	1
frightened	1
rostv	1
he	1
seized	1
his	1
pistol	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
firing	1
it	1
flung	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
frenchman	1
and	1
ran	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
toward	1
the	1
bushes	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
run	1
with	1
the	1

of	1
doubt	1
and	1
conflict	1
with	1
which	1
he	1

turning	1
his	1

a	1

just	1
as	1

changed	1

at	1

from	1

the	1

realized	1
that	1
something	1
dreadful	1
had	1

the	1

that	1

an	1

of	1
many	1
years	1
service	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
to	1
blame	1
might	1
be	1
held	1
responsible	1
at	1

for	1

so	1
staggered	1
him	1
that	1
forgetting	1
the	1

his	1

dignity	1
as	1

above	1
all	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
the	1
danger	1

all	1

he	1
clutched	1
the	1
crupper	1
of	1
his	1
saddle	1
and	1
spurring	1
his	1
horse	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1

under	1
a	1
hail	1
of	1
bullets	1
which	1
fell	1
around	1
but	1
fortunately	1
missed	1
him	1
his	1
one	1

was	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
and	1
at	1
any	1

correct	1
or	1
remedy	1
the	1

made	1

an	1

of	1
twentytwo	1

who	1
had	1
never	1
been	1

should	1
not	1
be	1
held	1
to	1
blame	1
having	1
galloped	1
safely	1
through	1
the	1
french	1
he	1
reached	1
a	1
field	1
behind	1
the	1
copse	1
across	1
which	1
our	1
men	1
regardless	1
of	1
orders	1
were	1
running	1
and	1
descending	1
the	1

that	1
moment	1
of	1
moral	1
hesitation	1
which	1
decides	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1

had	1
arrived	1
would	1
this	1
disorderly	1
crowd	1
of	1

attend	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
their	1
commander	1
or	1
would	1
they	1
disregarding	1
him	1
continue	1
their	1
flight	1
despite	1
his	1
desperate	1
shouts	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
seem	1
so	1
terrible	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
despite	1
his	1
furious	1
purple	1
countenance	1
distorted	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
likeness	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
self	1
and	1
the	1
flourishing	1
of	1
his	1
saber	1
the	1
soldiers	1
all	1
continued	1
to	1
run	1
talking	1
firing	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
disobeying	1
orders	1
the	1
moral	1
hesitation	1
which	1
decided	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
battles	1
was	1
evidently	1
culminating	1
in	1
a	1
panic	1
the	1
general	1
had	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
coughing	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
shouting	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
powder	1
smoke	1
and	1
stopped	1
in	1
despair	1
everything	1
seemed	1
lost	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
french	1
who	1
were	1
attacking	1
suddenly	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
apparent	1
reason	1
ran	1
back	1

disappeared	1
from	1

now	1
attacked	1
the	1
french	1
unexpectedly	1
timkhin	1
armed	1
only	1
with	1
a	1

had	1
rushed	1
at	1
the	1
enemy	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
desperate	1
cry	1
and	1
such	1
mad	1
drunken	1
determination	1
that	1
taken	1
by	1

had	1
thrown	1
down	1

run	1
dlokhov	1

killed	1
a	1

at	1
close	1
quarters	1

was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1

by	1
his	1
collar	1
our	1

for	1

moment	1
repulsed	1
our	1

up	1

the	1

at	1
an	1
end	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1

had	1
stopped	1
beside	1

letting	1
the	1

pass	1
by	1

when	1
a	1

up	1

of	1

stirrup	1
almost	1
leaning	1
against	1

the	1

was	1
pale	1
his	1
blue	1
eyes	1
looked	1
impudently	1
into	1
the	1
commanders	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
lips	1
were	1
smiling	1
though	1
the	1
commander	1
was	1
occupied	1
in	1
giving	1
instructions	1
to	1
major	1
ekonmov	1
he	1
could	1
not	1

taking	1
notice	1

your	1

taken	1
an	1

i	1
stopped	1
the	1

dlokhov	1
breathed	1
heavily	1
from	1
weariness	1
and	1
spoke	1
in	1
abrupt	1
sentences	1
the	1
whole	1

can	1
bear	1

i	1
beg	1
you	1
will	1
remember	1
this	1
your	1

all	1

all	1

replied	1
the	1

turned	1
to	1

dlokhov	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
away	1
he	1
untied	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
around	1
his	1
head	1
pulled	1
it	1
off	1
and	1
showed	1
the	1
blood	1
congealed	1
on	1
his	1
hair	1
a	1
bayonet	1
wound	1
i	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1

remember	1
your	1
excellency	1
tshins	1
battery	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
and	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
end	1
of	1
the	1

did	1
prince	1

still	1
hearing	1
the	1

in	1
the	1

send	1
his	1

also	1
to	1
order	1
the	1

as	1
possible	1

of	1
the	1

by	1
someones	1
order	1
the	1
battery	1
had	1
continued	1
firing	1
and	1
was	1
only	1
not	1
captured	1
by	1
the	1
french	1
because	1
the	1
enemy	1
could	1
not	1
surmise	1
that	1
anyone	1
could	1
have	1
the	1
effrontery	1
to	1
continue	1
firing	1
from	1
four	1
quite	1
undefended	1
guns	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
the	1
energetic	1
action	1
of	1
that	1

led	1
the	1

as	1

in	1
revenge	1
for	1
this	1
failure	1
the	1
enemy	1
placed	1
ten	1
guns	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1

and	1
began	1
firing	1
them	1
at	1
tshins	1

in	1
their	1
childlike	1
glee	1
aroused	1
by	1

their	1
luck	1
in	1
successfully	1
cannonading	1
the	1

only	1
noticed	1
this	1

when	1
two	1

four	1
more	1
fell	1
among	1

himself	1
amid	1

a	1

and	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1

reflected	1
on	1

not	1
experience	1
the	1

and	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
killed	1
or	1
badly	1
wounded	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
elated	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
time	1
ago	1
almost	1
a	1
day	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
first	1
seen	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
fired	1
the	1
first	1
shot	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
he	1
stood	1
on	1
was	1
wellknown	1
and	1
familiar	1
ground	1
though	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
everything	1
considered	1
everything	1
and	1
did	1
everything	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
officers	1
could	1
do	1
in	1
his	1
position	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
akin	1
to	1
feverish	1
delirium	1
or	1
drunkenness	1
from	1
the	1
deafening	1
sounds	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
guns	1
around	1
him	1
the	1
whistle	1
and	1
thud	1
of	1
the	1
enemys	1
cannon	1
balls	1
from	1
the	1
flushed	1
and	1
perspiring	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
bustling	1
round	1
the	1
guns	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1

horses	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
puffs	1
of	1
smoke	1
on	1
the	1

side	1
always	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1

striking	1

a	1

from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
a	1
fantastic	1
world	1
of	1
his	1
own	1

taken	1
possession	1
of	1
his	1
brain	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
afforded	1
him	1
pleasure	1
the	1
enemys	1
guns	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
fancy	1
not	1
guns	1
but	1
pipes	1
from	1
which	1
occasional	1

were	1
blown	1
by	1
an	1
invisible	1

there	1

to	1

standing	1
close	1

who	1
heard	1
him	1

nothing	1

a	1

gave	1
to	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

which	1
was	1
large	1
and	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
pattern	1
the	1
french	1
swarming	1
round	1
their	1
guns	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
ants	1
in	1
that	1

one	1

looked	1
at	1
him	1
more	1
often	1
than	1
at	1
anyone	1

and	1
took	1
delight	1
in	1
his	1
every	1
movement	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
musketry	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
now	1
diminishing	1
now	1
increasing	1

daughter	1
of	1
matthew	1
ah	1

again	1
breathing	1
he	1
muttered	1
to	1
himself	1
he	1
imagined	1
himself	1
as	1
an	1
enormously	1
tall	1
powerful	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
throwing	1
cannon	1
balls	1
at	1
the	1
french	1
with	1
both	1

now	1
then	1
matvvna	1

he	1
was	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
moved	1
from	1
the	1

when	1
a	1
strange	1

voice	1
called	1
above	1
his	1

captain	1
tshin	1
captain	1
tshin	1
turned	1
round	1
in	1
dismay	1
it	1
was	1
the	1

officer	1
who	1
had	1
turned	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
booth	1
at	1
grunth	1
he	1
was	1
shouting	1
in	1
a	1
gasping	1
voice	1
are	1

have	1
twice	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
retreat	1
and	1
you	1
why	1

they	1
down	1
on	1

thought	1
tshin	1
looking	1
in	1
alarm	1
at	1
his	1
superior	1
i	1

he	1
muttered	1
holding	1
up	1
two	1
fingers	1
to	1
his	1
cap	1
i	1
but	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
flying	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
duck	1
and	1
bend	1
over	1
his	1
horse	1
he	1
paused	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
more	1
another	1
ball	1
stopped	1
him	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1

galloped	1
off	1
retire	1
all	1
to	1
retire	1
he	1
shouted	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
the	1
soldiers	1
laughed	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
an	1
adjutant	1
arrived	1
with	1
the	1

order	1
it	1
was	1
prince	1
andrew	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
saw	1
on	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
space	1
where	1
tshins	1
guns	1
were	1
stationed	1
was	1
an	1
unharnessed	1
horse	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
leg	1
that	1
lay	1
screaming	1
piteously	1
beside	1
the	1
harnessed	1
horses	1
blood	1
was	1
gushing	1
from	1
its	1
leg	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
spring	1
among	1
the	1
limbers	1
lay	1
several	1
dead	1
men	1
one	1
ball	1
after	1
another	1
passed	1
over	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
nervous	1
shudder	1
run	1
down	1
his	1
spine	1
but	1
the	1
mere	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
afraid	1
roused	1
him	1
again	1
i	1
cannot	1
be	1
afraid	1
thought	1
he	1
and	1
dismounted	1
slowly	1
among	1
the	1
guns	1
he	1
delivered	1
the	1
order	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
battery	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
guns	1
removed	1
from	1
their	1
positions	1
and	1
withdrawn	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
together	1
with	1
tshin	1
stepping	1
across	1
the	1
bodies	1
and	1
under	1
a	1
terrible	1
fire	1
from	1
the	1
french	1

attended	1
to	1
the	1
removal	1
of	1
the	1

over	1
the	1

the	1
more	1
conspicuous	1
the	1

down	1

the	1
rattle	1
of	1

oftener	1

nearer	1

always	1
in	1

his	1

could	1

kept	1
closing	1

then	1
again	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1

seemed	1
to	1
him	1
dazzlingly	1
red	1

at	1

came	1
to	1

up	1

asked	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
the	1

moved	1
a	1
trifle	1
to	1
let	1
a	1

go	1
past	1
after	1
he	1

gone	1
two	1
soldiers	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1

they	1
were	1
quarreling	1

fighting	1
desperately	1

a	1
thin	1
pale	1
soldier	1
his	1

bandaged	1
with	1
a	1
bloodstained	1
leg	1
band	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
angry	1

asked	1
the	1

he	1

a	1

up	1
begging	1

sat	1
at	1
dinner	1
talking	1
with	1
some	1
commanding	1

at	1
his	1
quarters	1
the	1
little	1

man	1
with	1
the	1

there	1
greedily	1
gnawing	1
a	1
mutton	1

the	1

had	1
served	1
blamelessly	1
for	1
twentytwo	1
years	1
flushed	1
by	1
a	1

in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1

a	1

the	1

with	1
the	1
nave	1
face	1
was	1
feeling	1
its	1
texture	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
perplexityperhaps	1
because	1
the	1
banner	1
really	1
interested	1
him	1
perhaps	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
for	1
him	1
hungry	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
at	1
a	1
dinner	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
hut	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
french	1
colonel	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
by	1
our	1
dragoons	1
our	1
officers	1
were	1
flocking	1
in	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
was	1
thanking	1
the	1
individual	1
commanders	1
and	1
inquiring	1
into	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
our	1
losses	1
the	1
general	1
whose	1
regiment	1
had	1
been	1
inspected	1
at	1
braunau	1
was	1
informing	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
action	1
began	1
he	1
had	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
the	1
wood	1
mustered	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
woodcutting	1
and	1
allowing	1
the	1
french	1
to	1
pass	1
him	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
bayonet	1
charge	1
with	1
two	1
battalions	1
and	1
had	1
broken	1
up	1
the	1
french	1
troops	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
your	1
excellency	1
that	1
their	1
first	1
battalion	1
was	1
disorganized	1
i	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
thought	1
ill	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
on	1
and	1
will	1
meet	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
battalionand	1
thats	1
what	1
i	1
did	1
the	1
general	1
had	1
so	1
wished	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
sorry	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
managed	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
really	1
happened	1
perhaps	1
it	1
might	1
really	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
could	1
one	1
possibly	1
make	1
out	1
amid	1
all	1
that	1
confusion	1
what	1
did	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
happen	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
your	1
excellency	1

uneasily	1
around	1
he	1

not	1

the	1

all	1
that	1

had	1
heard	1
about	1
them	1
from	1
an	1
infantry	1
officer	1
they	1
broke	1
up	1
two	1
squares	1
your	1

several	1
of	1

smiled	1
at	1

one	1
of	1

noticing	1
that	1
what	1

redounded	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
our	1

and	1
of	1
the	1
days	1

they	1
assumed	1
a	1
serious	1
expression	1
though	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
knew	1
that	1
what	1

was	1

was	1

how	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
two	1

were	1

in	1

he	1
inquired	1
searching	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
for	1
someone	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
about	1
the	1
guns	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
guns	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1

turning	1
to	1
the	1

answered	1
the	1

the	1
other	1
i	1
cant	1

i	1
was	1
there	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
giving	1
orders	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
left	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
hot	1
there	1
he	1
added	1
modestly	1
someone	1
mentioned	1
that	1
captain	1
tshin	1
was	1
bivouacking	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
had	1
already	1

for	1
oh	1

you	1
were	1
there	1

addressing	1
prince	1
andrew	1

we	1
only	1
just	1
missed	1

another	1
said	1
the	1

officer	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
bolknski	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
you	1
said	1
prince	1
andrew	1
coldly	1
and	1
abruptly	1
all	1
were	1
silent	1
tshin	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
threshold	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
timidly	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
the	1
generals	1
as	1
he	1
stepped	1
past	1
the	1
generals	1
in	1
the	1
crowded	1
hut	1
feeling	1
embarrassed	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
superiors	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
banner	1
and	1
stumbled	1
over	1
it	1
several	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
laughed	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
a	1
gun	1
was	1
abandoned	1
asked	1
bagratin	1
frowning	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
at	1
the	1
captain	1
as	1
at	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
laughing	1
among	1
whom	1
zherkv	1
laughed	1
loudest	1
only	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
confronted	1
by	1
the	1
stern	1
authorities	1
did	1
his	1
guilt	1
and	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
having	1
lost	1
two	1
guns	1
and	1
yet	1
remaining	1
alive	1
present	1
themselves	1
to	1
tshin	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
horror	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
excited	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
about	1
it	1
until	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
officers	1
laughter	1
confused	1
him	1
still	1
more	1
he	1
stood	1
before	1
bagratin	1
with	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw	1
trembling	1
and	1
was	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
mutter	1
i	1
dont	1
know	1
your	1
excellency	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
men	1
your	1
excellency	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
taken	1
some	1
from	1
the	1
covering	1
troops	1
tshin	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
covering	1
troops	1
though	1
that	1
was	1
perfectly	1
true	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
getting	1
some	1
other	1
officer	1
into	1
trouble	1
and	1
silently	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
bagratin	1
as	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
who	1
has	1
blundered	1
looks	1
at	1
an	1
examiner	1
the	1
silence	1
lasted	1
some	1
time	1
prince	1
bagratin	1
apparently	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
be	1
severe	1
found	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
others	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
intervene	1
prince	1
andrew	1
looked	1
at	1
tshin	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1

at	1

we	1
owe	1

to	1
the	1

the	1
heroic	1
endurance	1
of	1

bent	1

nothing	1

went	1
away	1
he	1
felt	1
sad	1
and	1
depressed	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
so	1
strange	1
so	1
unlike	1
what	1

him	1
red	1

danced	1
before	1
his	1

the	1
impression	1
of	1
those	1

a	1

in	1

innumerable	1

this	1

incessantly	1
pulling	1

always	1

to	1
whom	1
getting	1

had	1

a	1
habit	1
schemes	1

devices	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
never	1

accounted	1
to	1

dozens	1

only	1
beginning	1
to	1
form	1
themselves	1
some	1
approaching	1
achievement	1
and	1
some	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
disintegration	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
for	1

say	1
to	1

this	1

when	1
he	1
came	1
across	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
position	1
his	1
instinct	1
immediately	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
this	1

could	1
be	1
useful	1

without	1
any	1

finally	1
make	1
his	1
request	1
he	1
had	1
pierre	1
at	1
hand	1
in	1
moscow	1
and	1
procured	1
for	1
him	1
an	1
appointment	1
as	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
which	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
conferred	1
the	1
status	1
of	1
councilor	1
of	1

insisted	1
on	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
accompanying	1
him	1
to	1
petersburg	1
and	1
staying	1
at	1
his	1
house	1
with	1
apparent	1

with	1
unhesitating	1
assurance	1
that	1

with	1
everybody	1
both	1
above	1

below	1
him	1
in	1

something	1
always	1
drew	1
him	1
toward	1
those	1
richer	1
and	1
more	1
powerful	1
than	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
rare	1
skill	1
in	1
seizing	1
the	1
most	1
opportune	1
moment	1
for	1
making	1
use	1
of	1
people	1

on	1
unexpectedly	1
becoming	1

himself	1
after	1
his	1
recent	1
loneliness	1
and	1
freedom	1
from	1
cares	1
so	1
beset	1
and	1
preoccupied	1
that	1
only	1
in	1

was	1
he	1
able	1
to	1
be	1
by	1
himself	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
sign	1
papers	1
to	1
present	1
himself	1
at	1
government	1
offices	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
clear	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
question	1
his	1
chief	1
steward	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
estate	1
near	1
moscow	1
and	1
to	1
receive	1
many	1
people	1
who	1
formerly	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
his	1
existence	1
but	1
would	1
now	1
have	1
been	1
offended	1
and	1
grieved	1

he	1
chosen	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
these	1
different	1

disposed	1
to	1
treat	1
the	1
young	1
heir	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
friendly	1
and	1
flattering	1
manner	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
evidently	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
of	1
pierres	1
noble	1
qualities	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
hearing	1
such	1
words	1
as	1
with	1
your	1
remarkable	1
kindness	1
or	1
with	1
your	1
excellent	1
heart	1
you	1
are	1
yourself	1
so	1
honorable	1
count	1
or	1
were	1
he	1
as	1
clever	1
as	1
you	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
till	1
he	1
began	1
sincerely	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
exceptional	1
kindness	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
intelligence	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
it	1
had	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
really	1
was	1
very	1
kind	1
and	1
intelligent	1
even	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
spiteful	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
evidently	1
unfriendly	1
now	1
became	1
gentle	1
and	1
affectionate	1
the	1
angry	1
eldest	1
princess	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
waist	1
and	1
hair	1
plastered	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
dolls	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
pierres	1
room	1
after	1
the	1
funeral	1
with	1
drooping	1
eyes	1
and	1
frequent	1
blushes	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
sorry	1
about	1
their	1
past	1
misunderstandings	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
feel	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
for	1
anything	1
except	1
only	1
for	1
permission	1
after	1
the	1
blow	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
to	1
remain	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
she	1
so	1
loved	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
sacrificed	1
so	1
much	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
weeping	1
at	1
these	1
words	1
touched	1
that	1
this	1
statuesque	1
princess	1
could	1
so	1
change	1
pierre	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
begged	1
her	1
forgiveness	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
for	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
quite	1
changed	1
toward	1
pierre	1
and	1
began	1
knitting	1
a	1
striped	1
scarf	1
for	1
him	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
mon	1
cher	1
after	1
all	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
from	1
the	1
deceased	1
said	1
prince	1
vasli	1
to	1
him	1
handing	1
him	1
a	1
deed	1
to	1
sign	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
benefit	1
prince	1
vasli	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
throw	1
this	1
bonea	1
bill	1
for	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
rublesto	1
the	1
poor	1
princess	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
occur	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
inlaid	1
portfolio	1
pierre	1
signed	1
the	1
deed	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
grew	1
still	1
kinder	1
the	1
younger	1
sisters	1
also	1
became	1
affectionate	1
to	1
him	1
especially	1
the	1
youngest	1
the	1
pretty	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
mole	1
who	1
often	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
confused	1
by	1
her	1
smiles	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
confusion	1
when	1
meeting	1
him	1
it	1
seemed	1
so	1
natural	1
to	1
pierre	1
that	1
everyone	1
should	1
like	1
him	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
so	1
unnatural	1
had	1
anyone	1
disliked	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
those	1
around	1
him	1
besides	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
ask	1
himself	1
whether	1
these	1
people	1
were	1
sincere	1
or	1
not	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
busy	1
and	1
always	1
felt	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
mild	1
and	1
cheerful	1
intoxication	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
some	1
important	1
and	1
general	1
movement	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
constantly	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
he	1
would	1
grieve	1
and	1
disappoint	1
many	1
people	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
what	1
was	1
demanded	1
of	1
him	1
but	1
still	1
that	1
happy	1
result	1
always	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
more	1
than	1
anyone	1
else	1
prince	1
vasli	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
pierres	1

of	1

himself	1
in	1
those	1
early	1
days	1
from	1
the	1
death	1
of	1

he	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
go	1
his	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
lad	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
oppressed	1
by	1
business	1
weary	1
and	1
suffering	1
who	1
yet	1
would	1
not	1
for	1

youth	1

after	1

the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1

and	1
the	1
possessor	1
of	1

enormous	1
wealth	1

few	1
days	1
he	1
spent	1
in	1
moscow	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
count	1
bezkhov	1
he	1
would	1
call	1
pierre	1
or	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
himself	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
what	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
assurance	1

you	1

been	1
considering	1
his	1

wished	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
suggestion	1
but	1
prince	1
vasli	1
interrupted	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
special	1
deep	1
cooing	1
tone	1
precluding	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
interrupting	1
his	1

which	1
he	1
used	1
in	1
extreme	1
cases	1
when	1

the	1

retained	1
for	1

as	1
in	1

pierre	1
found	1
the	1

atmosphere	1
of	1
gentleness	1
and	1
affection	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
the	1
post	1

rather	1
the	1
rank	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
nothing	1
that	1
prince	1

had	1
procured	1
for	1
him	1

acquaintances	1

and	1
social	1
occupations	1
were	1
so	1
numerous	1
that	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
moscow	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
bewilderment	1
bustle	1
and	1
continual	1
expectation	1
of	1
some	1
good	1
always	1
in	1

of	1

never	1

not	1
the	1

his	1
nights	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
like	1
to	1

to	1
open	1
his	1
mind	1
by	1
intimate	1

with	1
a	1

respected	1
his	1
whole	1

up	1
with	1

was	1

at	1

showed	1

the	1
change	1
of	1
attitude	1
toward	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
society	1
formerly	1
in	1
anna	1
pvlovnas	1
presence	1
pierre	1
had	1
always	1
felt	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
tactless	1
and	1
unsuitable	1
that	1
remarks	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
clever	1
while	1
they	1
formed	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
became	1
foolish	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
uttered	1
them	1
while	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
hippolytes	1
stupidest	1
remarks	1
came	1
out	1
clever	1

apt	1
now	1
everything	1

was	1
charmant	1
even	1
if	1
anna	1

did	1
not	1
say	1
so	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
and	1
only	1
refrained	1
out	1
of	1
regard	1
for	1
his	1
modesty	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
of	1
pierre	1
received	1
one	1
of	1

usual	1
pink	1

it	1
is	1
always	1
delightful	1
to	1
see	1
when	1
he	1
read	1
that	1
sentence	1
pierre	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
some	1
link	1
which	1
other	1
people	1
recognized	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
hlne	1
and	1
that	1
thought	1
both	1
alarmed	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
obligation	1
were	1
being	1
imposed	1
on	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
fulfill	1

from	1

with	1
the	1
very	1
latest	1
details	1
of	1
the	1

of	1

received	1
pierre	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
melancholy	1
evidently	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
mans	1
recent	1
loss	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
count	1

everyone	1
constantly	1
considered	1
it	1
a	1

greatly	1
afflicted	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1

he	1
had	1
hardly	1
known	1
and	1
her	1
melancholy	1
was	1
just	1
like	1

august	1
melancholy	1
she	1
showed	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1

to	1

some	1
final	1
necessary	1
instructions	1
isnt	1

said	1
to	1

pointing	1
to	1
the	1
stately	1

she	1
glided	1
away	1

let	1

go	1
pierre	1
in	1
reply	1
sincerely	1
agreed	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
to	1
hlnes	1
perfection	1
of	1
manner	1
if	1
he	1
ever	1
thought	1
of	1
hlne	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
her	1
remarkable	1
skill	1
in	1
appearing	1
silently	1
dignified	1
in	1
society	1
the	1
old	1
aunt	1
received	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
people	1
in	1
her	1
corner	1
but	1
seemed	1
desirous	1
of	1
hiding	1
her	1
adoration	1
for	1
hlne	1
and	1
inclined	1
rather	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
fear	1
of	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
niece	1
as	1
if	1

was	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
these	1
people	1
on	1
leaving	1
them	1

pvlovna	1
again	1
touched	1

saying	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
wont	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
dull	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
again	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
hlne	1
hlne	1
smiled	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
implying	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
anyone	1
seeing	1
her	1
without	1
being	1
enchanted	1
the	1
aunt	1
coughed	1
swallowed	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
french	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
hlne	1
then	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
pierre	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
of	1
welcome	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
look	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
dull	1
and	1
halting	1
conversation	1
hlne	1
turned	1
to	1
pierre	1
with	1
the	1
beautiful	1
bright	1
smile	1
that	1
she	1
gave	1
to	1
everyone	1
pierre	1
was	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
that	1
smile	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
so	1
little	1
meaning	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
aunt	1
was	1
just	1
speaking	1
of	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
snuffboxes	1
that	1
had	1
belonged	1
to	1
pierres	1
father	1
count	1
bezkhov	1
and	1
showed	1
them	1
her	1
own	1
box	1
princess	1
hlne	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
the	1
aunts	1
husband	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
lid	1
that	1
is	1
probably	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
vinesse	1
said	1
pierre	1
mentioning	1
a	1
celebrated	1
miniaturist	1
and	1
he	1
leaned	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
snuffbox	1
while	1
trying	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
table	1
he	1
half	1
rose	1
meaning	1
to	1
go	1
round	1
but	1
the	1
aunt	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
snuffbox	1
passing	1
it	1
across	1
hlnes	1
back	1
hlne	1
stooped	1
forward	1
to	1
make	1
room	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
always	1
at	1
evening	1
parties	1
wearing	1
a	1
dress	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
then	1
fashionable	1
cut	1
very	1
low	1
at	1
front	1
and	1
back	1
her	1
bust	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
seemed	1
like	1
marble	1
to	1
pierre	1
was	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
shortsighted	1
eyes	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
perceive	1
the	1
living	1
charm	1
of	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
that	1
he	1
need	1
only	1
have	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
have	1
touched	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
her	1
body	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
perfume	1
and	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
her	1
corset	1
as	1
she	1
moved	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
her	1
marble	1
beauty	1
forming	1
a	1
complete	1
whole	1
with	1
her	1
dress	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
her	1
body	1
only	1
covered	1
by	1
her	1

being	1

of	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
cannot	1
renew	1
an	1

at	1

pierre	1
felt	1
that	1

not	1

but	1
must	1
be	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise	1
he	1
knew	1
this	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
as	1
surely	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
altar	1
with	1
her	1
how	1
and	1
when	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
he	1

not	1
even	1

a	1

he	1
even	1
felt	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
why	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
thing	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
would	1
happen	1
pierre	1
dropped	1
his	1
eyes	1
lifted	1
them	1
again	1
and	1
wished	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
distant	1
beauty	1
far	1
removed	1
from	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
every	1
day	1
until	1
then	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
do	1
it	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
tuft	1
of	1
steppe	1
grass	1
through	1
the	1
mist	1
and	1
taking	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
tree	1
can	1
again	1
take	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
tree	1
after	1
he	1
has	1
once	1
recognized	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
tuft	1
of	1
grass	1
she	1
was	1
terribly	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
already	1
had	1
power	1
over	1
him	1
and	1
between	1
them	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
barrier	1
except	1
the	1
barrier	1
of	1

you	1
are	1
all	1
right	1
there	1
and	1
pierre	1
anxiously	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
anything	1
reprehensible	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
blush	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
everyone	1
knew	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
himself	1
a	1
little	1
later	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
circle	1
anna	1
pvlovna	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
hear	1
you	1
are	1
refitting	1
your	1
petersburg	1
house	1
this	1
was	1
true	1
the	1
architect	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
and	1
pierre	1
without	1
knowing	1
why	1
was	1
having	1
his	1
enormous	1
petersburg	1
house	1
done	1
up	1
thats	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
but	1
dont	1
move	1
from	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
friend	1
like	1
the	1
prince	1
she	1
said	1
smiling	1
at	1
prince	1
vasli	1
i	1
know	1
something	1
about	1
that	1
dont	1
i	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
still	1
so	1
young	1
you	1
need	1
advice	1
dont	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
exercising	1
an	1
old	1
womans	1
privilege	1
she	1
paused	1
as	1
women	1
always	1
do	1
expecting	1
something	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
mentioned	1
their	1
age	1
if	1
you	1
marry	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
different	1
thing	1
she	1
continued	1
uniting	1
them	1
both	1
in	1
one	1
glance	1
pierre	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
hlne	1
nor	1
she	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
terribly	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
muttered	1
something	1
and	1
colored	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
home	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
for	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
nothing	1
he	1
had	1
merely	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
whom	1
when	1
her	1
beauty	1
was	1
mentioned	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
absentmindedly	1
yes	1
shes	1
good	1
looking	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
that	1
this	1
woman	1
might	1
belong	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
shes	1
stupid	1
i	1
have	1
myself	1
said	1
she	1
is	1
stupid	1
he	1
thought	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
nasty	1
something	1
wrong	1
in	1
the	1
feeling	1
she	1
excites	1
in	1
me	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
her	1
brother	1
anatole	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
scandal	1
and	1
that	1
thats	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
away	1
hippolyte	1
is	1
her	1
brother	1
prince	1
vasli	1
is	1
her	1
father	1
its	1
bad	1
he	1
reflected	1
but	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
this	1
the	1
reflection	1
was	1
still	1
incomplete	1
he	1
caught	1
himself	1
smiling	1
and	1
was	1
conscious	1
that	1
another	1
line	1
of	1
thought	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
and	1
while	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
worthlessness	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
dreaming	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
his	1
wife	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
love	1
him	1
become	1
quite	1
different	1
and	1
how	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
and	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
might	1
be	1
false	1
and	1
he	1
again	1
saw	1
her	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
prince	1
vasli	1
but	1
visualized	1
her	1
whole	1
body	1
only	1
veiled	1
by	1
its	1
gray	1
dress	1
but	1
no	1
why	1
did	1
this	1
thought	1
never	1
occur	1
to	1
me	1
before	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
something	1
unnatural	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
dishonorable	1
in	1
this	1
marriage	1
he	1
recalled	1
her	1
former	1
words	1
and	1
looks	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
looks	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
together	1
he	1
recalled	1
anna	1
pvlovnas	1
words	1
and	1
looks	1
when	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
house	1
recalled	1
thousands	1
of	1
such	1
hints	1
from	1
prince	1
vasli	1
and	1
others	1
and	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
terror	1
lest	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
bound	1
himself	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
evidently	1
wrong	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
expressing	1
this	1
conviction	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1

image	1

in	1
all	1
its	1
womanly	1
beauty	1

in	1
november	1
prince	1
vasli	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
a	1
tour	1
of	1
inspection	1
in	1
four	1
different	1
provinces	1
he	1
had	1
arranged	1
this	1
for	1
himself	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
neglected	1
estates	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
and	1
pick	1
up	1
his	1
son	1
anatole	1
where	1
his	1
regiment	1
was	1
stationed	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
visit	1
prince	1
nicholas	1
bolknski	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
arrange	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
that	1
rich	1
old	1
man	1
but	1
before	1
leaving	1
home	1
and	1
undertaking	1
these	1
new	1
affairs	1
prince	1
vasli	1
had	1
to	1
settle	1
matters	1
with	1
pierre	1
who	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
had	1
latterly	1
spent	1
whole	1
days	1
at	1
home	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
house	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
staying	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
absurd	1
excited	1
and	1
foolish	1
in	1
hlnes	1
presence	1
as	1
a	1
lover	1
should	1
be	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
proposed	1
to	1
her	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
fine	1
but	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
settled	1
said	1
prince	1

to	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
sigh	1
one	1
morning	1
feeling	1
that	1
pierre	1

was	1
under	1
such	1
obligations	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
never	1

her	1
father	1
six	1
weeks	1
after	1
anna	1
pvlovnas	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
sleepless	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
decided	1
that	1
to	1
marry	1
hlne	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
calamity	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
avoid	1
her	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
pierre	1
despite	1
that	1
decision	1
had	1
not	1
left	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
and	1
felt	1
with	1
terror	1
that	1
in	1
peoples	1
eyes	1
he	1
was	1
every	1
day	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
connected	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
conception	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
break	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
unite	1
his	1
fate	1
with	1
hers	1
he	1
might	1
perhaps	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
free	1
himself	1
but	1
that	1
prince	1
vasli	1
who	1
had	1
rarely	1
before	1
given	1
receptions	1
now	1
hardly	1
let	1
a	1
day	1
go	1
by	1
without	1
having	1
an	1
evening	1
party	1
at	1
which	1
pierre	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
unless	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
spoil	1
the	1
general	1
pleasure	1
and	1
disappoint	1
everyones	1
expectation	1
prince	1
vasli	1
in	1
the	1
rare	1
moments	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
would	1
take	1
pierres	1
hand	1
in	1
passing	1
and	1
draw	1
it	1
downwards	1
or	1
absentmindedly	1
hold	1
out	1
his	1
wrinkled	1
cleanshaven	1
cheek	1
for	1
pierre	1
to	1
kiss	1
and	1
would	1
say	1
till	1
tomorrow	1
or	1
be	1
in	1
to	1
dinner	1
or	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
you	1
or	1
i	1
am	1
staying	1
in	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
and	1
though	1
prince	1
vasli	1
when	1
he	1
stayed	1
in	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
for	1
pierres	1
sake	1
hardly	1
exchanged	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
words	1
with	1
him	1
pierre	1
felt	1
unable	1
to	1
disappoint	1
him	1
every	1
day	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
i	1
understood	1
her	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
what	1
she	1
really	1
is	1
was	1
i	1
mistaken	1
before	1
or	1
am	1
i	1
mistaken	1
now	1
no	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
stupid	1
she	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
girl	1
he	1
sometimes	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
she	1
never	1
makes	1
a	1
mistake	1
never	1
says	1
anything	1
stupid	1
she	1
says	1
little	1
but	1
what	1
she	1
does	1
say	1
is	1
always	1
clear	1
and	1
simple	1
so	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
stupid	1
she	1
never	1
was	1
abashed	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
abashed	1
now	1
so	1
she	1
cannot	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
woman	1
he	1
had	1
often	1
begun	1
to	1
make	1
reflections	1
or	1
think	1
aloud	1
in	1
her	1
company	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
answered	1
him	1
either	1
by	1
a	1
brief	1
but	1
appropriate	1
remarkshowing	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
heror	1
by	1
a	1
silent	1
look	1
and	1
smile	1
which	1
more	1
palpably	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
showed	1
pierre	1
her	1
superiority	1
she	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
regarding	1
all	1
arguments	1
as	1
nonsense	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
that	1
smile	1
she	1
always	1
addressed	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
radiantly	1
confiding	1
smile	1
meant	1
for	1
him	1
alone	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
more	1
significant	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
smile	1
that	1
usually	1
brightened	1
her	1
face	1
pierre	1
knew	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
cross	1
a	1
certain	1
line	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
he	1
would	1
step	1
across	1
it	1
but	1
an	1
incomprehensible	1
terror	1
seized	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
dreadful	1
step	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
during	1
that	1
month	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
while	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
drawn	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
that	1
dreadful	1
abyss	1
pierre	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
what	1
am	1
i	1
doing	1
i	1
need	1
resolution	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
none	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
decision	1
but	1
felt	1
with	1
dismay	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
he	1
lacked	1
that	1
strength	1
of	1
will	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
himself	1
and	1
really	1
possessed	1
pierre	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
only	1
strong	1
when	1
they	1
feel	1
themselves	1
quite	1
innocent	1
and	1
since	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
overpowered	1
by	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
desire	1
while	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1

declarations	1
of	1
the	1

loyalty	1
that	1
the	1

that	1

was	1
proud	1
to	1

again	1

as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
uttered	1
sergy	1
he	1
sobbed	1
kuzmch	1

from	1
all	1

was	1
smothered	1
in	1
sobs	1
and	1
he	1
could	1

no	1
farther	1

again	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
again	1

from	1

somebody	1

excellent	1
man	1
our	1

everybody	1
laughed	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
the	1
honored	1
guests	1
sat	1
everyone	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
high	1
spirits	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
exciting	1
sensations	1
only	1
pierre	1
and	1
hlne	1
sat	1
silently	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
a	1
suppressed	1
smile	1
brightening	1
both	1
their	1
faces	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
sergy	1
kuzmcha	1
smile	1
of	1
bashfulness	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
feelings	1
but	1
much	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
laughed	1
talked	1
and	1
joked	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
enjoyed	1
their	1
rhine	1
wine	1
saut	1
and	1
ices	1
and	1
however	1
they	1
avoided	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
couple	1
and	1
heedless	1
and	1
unobservant	1
as	1
they	1
seemed	1
of	1
them	1
one	1
could	1
feel	1
by	1
the	1
occasional	1
glances	1
they	1
gave	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
about	1
sergy	1
kuzmch	1
the	1
laughter	1
and	1
the	1
food	1
were	1
all	1
a	1
pretense	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
attention	1
of	1
that	1
company	1
was	1
directed	1
topierre	1
and	1
hlne	1
prince	1
vasli	1
mimicked	1
the	1
sobbing	1
of	1
sergy	1
kuzmch	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
his	1
eyes	1
glanced	1
toward	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
laughed	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
clearly	1
said	1

threatened	1
him	1
on	1

of	1
our	1
dear	1
vyazmtinov	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
which	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
glanced	1
at	1
pierre	1
prince	1
vasli	1
read	1
a	1
congratulation	1
on	1
his	1
future	1
soninlaw	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
daughters	1
happiness	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
sighed	1
sadly	1
as	1
she	1
offered	1
some	1
wine	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
next	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
glanced	1
angrily	1
at	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
her	1
sigh	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
yes	1
theres	1
nothing	1
left	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
me	1
but	1
to	1
sip	1
sweet	1
wine	1
my	1
dear	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
for	1
these	1
young	1
ones	1
to	1
be	1
thus	1
boldly	1
provocatively	1
happy	1
and	1
what	1
nonsense	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
saying	1
thought	1
a	1
diplomatist	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
happy	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
lovers	1
thats	1
happiness	1
into	1
the	1
insignificant	1
trifling	1
and	1
artificial	1
interests	1
uniting	1
that	1
society	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
simple	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
attraction	1
of	1
a	1
healthy	1
and	1
handsome	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
woman	1
for	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
this	1
human	1
feeling	1
dominated	1
everything	1
else	1
and	1
soared	1
above	1
all	1
their	1
affected	1
chatter	1
jests	1
fell	1
flat	1
news	1
was	1
not	1
interesting	1
and	1
the	1
animation	1
was	1
evidently	1
forced	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
guests	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
footmen	1
waiting	1
at	1
table	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
this	1
and	1
they	1
forgot	1
their	1
duties	1
as	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
beautiful	1
hlne	1
with	1
her	1
radiant	1
face	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
red	1
broad	1
and	1
happy	1
though	1
uneasy	1
face	1
of	1
pierre	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
very	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
candles	1
was	1
focused	1
on	1
those	1
two	1
happy	1
faces	1
alone	1
pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
this	1
both	1
pleased	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
entirely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
some	1
occupation	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
hear	1
or	1
understand	1
anything	1
clearly	1
only	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
detached	1
ideas	1
and	1
impressions	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
reality	1
shot	1
unexpectedly	1
through	1
his	1
mind	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
finished	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
how	1
has	1
it	1
all	1
happened	1
how	1
quickly	1
now	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
her	1
alone	1
nor	1
of	1
myself	1
alone	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
everyone	1
it	1
must	1
inevitably	1
come	1
about	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
expecting	1
it	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
sure	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
happen	1
that	1
i	1
cannot	1
i	1
cannot	1
disappoint	1
them	1
but	1
how	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
certainly	1
happen	1
thought	1
pierre	1
glancing	1
at	1
those	1
dazzling	1
shoulders	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
eyes	1
or	1
he	1
would	1
suddenly	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
of	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
awkward	1
to	1
attract	1
everyones	1
attention	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
a	1
lucky	1
man	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
plain	1
face	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
on	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
paris	1
possessed	1
of	1
a	1
helen	1
but	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
always	1
is	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
he	1
consoled	1
himself	1
and	1
besides	1
what	1
have	1
i	1
done	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
about	1
how	1
did	1
it	1
begin	1
i	1
traveled	1
from	1
moscow	1
with	1
prince	1
vasli	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
so	1
why	1
should	1
i	1
not	1
stay	1
at	1
his	1
house	1
then	1
i	1
played	1
cards	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
picked	1
up	1
her	1
reticule	1
and	1
drove	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
how	1
did	1
it	1
begin	1
when	1
did	1
it	1
all	1
come	1
about	1
and	1
here	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
by	1
her	1
side	1
as	1
her	1
betrothed	1
seeing	1
hearing	1
feeling	1
her	1
nearness	1
her	1
breathing	1
her	1
movements	1
her	1
beauty	1
then	1
it	1
would	1
suddenly	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
she	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
unusually	1
beautiful	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
why	1
they	1
all	1
looked	1
so	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
flattered	1
by	1
this	1
general	1
admiration	1
he	1
would	1
expand	1
his	1
chest	1
raise	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
rejoice	1
at	1
his	1
good	1
fortune	1
suddenly	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
familiar	1
voice	1
repeating	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
but	1
pierre	1
was	1
so	1
absorbed	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
i	1
am	1
asking	1
you	1
when	1
you	1
last	1
heard	1
from	1
bolknski	1
repeated	1
prince	1
vasli	1
a	1
third	1
time	1
how	1
absentminded	1
you	1
are	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
prince	1
vasli	1
smiled	1
and	1
pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
smiling	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
hlne	1
well	1
what	1
of	1
it	1
if	1
you	1
all	1
know	1
it	1
thought	1
pierre	1
what	1
of	1
it	1
its	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
smiled	1
his	1
gentle	1
childlike	1
smile	1
and	1
hlne	1
smiled	1
too	1
when	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
it	1
from	1
olmtz	1
repeated	1
prince	1
vasli	1
who	1
pretended	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
this	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
settle	1
a	1
dispute	1
how	1
can	1
one	1
talk	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
trifles	1
thought	1
pierre	1
yes	1
from	1
olmtz	1
he	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
after	1
supper	1
pierre	1
with	1
his	1
partner	1
followed	1
the	1
others	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
the	1
guests	1
began	1
to	1
disperse	1
some	1
without	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
hlne	1
some	1
as	1
if	1
unwilling	1
to	1
distract	1
her	1
from	1
an	1
important	1
occupation	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
refusing	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
see	1
them	1
off	1
the	1
diplomatist	1
preserved	1
a	1
mournful	1
silence	1
as	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
he	1
pictured	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
his	1
diplomatic	1
career	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
pierres	1
happiness	1
the	1
old	1
general	1
grumbled	1
at	1
his	1
wife	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
how	1
his	1
leg	1
was	1
oh	1
the	1
old	1
fool	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1

the	1

princess	1
did	1
not	1

she	1
was	1
tormented	1
by	1
jealousy	1
of	1
her	1
daughters	1
happiness	1
while	1
the	1
guests	1
were	1
taking	1
their	1
leave	1

for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
alone	1
with	1
hlne	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1

her	1
of	1
love	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
inevitable	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
final	1
step	1
he	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
occupying	1
someone	1
elses	1
place	1
here	1
beside	1
hlne	1
this	1
happiness	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
you	1
some	1
inner	1
voice	1
whispered	1
to	1
him	1
this	1
happiness	1
is	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
in	1
them	1
what	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
he	1
began	1
by	1
asking	1
her	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
party	1
she	1
replied	1
in	1
her	1
usual	1
simple	1
manner	1
that	1
this	1
name	1
day	1
of	1
hers	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pleasantest	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
had	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
nearest	1
relatives	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
left	1
they	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
drawing	1
room	1
prince	1
vasli	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
pierre	1
with	1
languid	1
footsteps	1
pierre	1
rose	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
getting	1
late	1
prince	1
vasli	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
stern	1
inquiry	1
as	1
though	1
what	1
pierre	1
had	1
just	1
said	1
was	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
it	1
in	1
but	1
then	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
severity	1
changed	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
pierres	1
hand	1
downwards	1
made	1
him	1
sit	1
down	1
and	1
smiled	1
affectionately	1
well	1
llya	1
he	1
asked	1
turning	1
instantly	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
addressing	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
careless	1
tone	1
of	1
habitual	1
tenderness	1
natural	1
to	1
parents	1
who	1
have	1
petted	1
their	1
children	1
from	1
babyhood	1
but	1
which	1
prince	1
vasli	1
had	1
only	1
acquired	1
by	1
imitating	1
other	1
parents	1
and	1
he	1
again	1
turned	1
to	1
pierre	1
sergy	1
kuzmchfrom	1
all	1
sides	1
he	1
said	1
unbuttoning	1
the	1
top	1
button	1
of	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
pierre	1
smiled	1
but	1
his	1
smile	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
story	1
about	1
sergy	1
kuzmch	1
that	1
interested	1
prince	1
vasli	1
just	1
then	1
and	1
prince	1
vasli	1
saw	1
that	1
pierre	1
knew	1
this	1
he	1
suddenly	1
muttered	1
something	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
pierre	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
disconcerted	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
discomposure	1
of	1
that	1
old	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
touched	1
pierre	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
hlne	1
and	1
she	1
too	1
seemed	1
disconcerted	1
and	1
her	1
look	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
well	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
own	1
fault	1
the	1
step	1
must	1
be	1
taken	1
but	1
i	1
cannot	1
i	1
cannot	1
thought	1
pierre	1
and	1
he	1
again	1
began	1
speaking	1
about	1
indifferent	1
matters	1
about	1
sergy	1
kuzmch	1
asking	1
what	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
was	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
it	1
properly	1
hlne	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
had	1
missed	1
it	1
when	1
prince	1
vasli	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
the	1
princess	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
talking	1
in	1
low	1
tones	1
to	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady	1
about	1
pierre	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
brilliant	1
match	1
but	1
happiness	1
my	1
dear	1
marriages	1
are	1
made	1
in	1
heaven	1
replied	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady	1
prince	1
vasli	1
passed	1
by	1
seeming	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
in	1
a	1
far	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
dozing	1
his	1
head	1
sank	1
forward	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
roused	1
himself	1
aline	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
about	1
the	1
princess	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
passed	1
by	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
dignified	1
and	1
indifferent	1
air	1
and	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
pierre	1
and	1
hlne	1
still	1
sat	1
talking	1
just	1
as	1
before	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
prince	1
vasli	1
frowned	1
twisting	1
his	1
mouth	1
his	1
cheeks	1
quivered	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
the	1
coarse	1
unpleasant	1
expression	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him	1
shaking	1
himself	1
he	1
rose	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
with	1
resolute	1
steps	1
went	1
past	1
the	1
ladies	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
quick	1
steps	1
he	1
went	1
joyfully	1
up	1
to	1
pierre	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
unusually	1
triumphant	1
that	1
pierre	1
rose	1
in	1
alarm	1
on	1
seeing	1
it	1
thank	1
god	1
said	1
prince	1
vasli	1
my	1
wife	1
has	1
told	1
me	1
everything	1
he	1
put	1
one	1
arm	1
around	1
pierre	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
around	1
his	1
daughtermy	1
dear	1
boy	1
llya	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
pleased	1
his	1
voice	1
trembled	1
i	1
loved	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
good	1
wife	1
god	1
bless	1
you	1
he	1
embraced	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
pierre	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
malodorous	1
mouth	1
tears	1
actually	1
moistened	1
his	1
cheeks	1
princess	1
come	1
here	1
he	1
shouted	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
also	1
wept	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady	1
was	1
using	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
too	1
pierre	1
was	1
kissed	1
and	1
he	1
kissed	1
the	1
beautiful	1
hlnes	1
hand	1
several	1
times	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
again	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise	1
thought	1
pierre	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
useless	1
to	1
ask	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
or	1
bad	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
because	1
its	1
definite	1
and	1
one	1
is	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
tormenting	1
doubt	1
pierre	1
held	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
betrothed	1
in	1
silence	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
beautiful	1
bosom	1
as	1
it	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
hlne	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
and	1
paused	1
something	1
special	1
is	1
always	1
said	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
he	1
thought	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
people	1
say	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
her	1
face	1
flushed	1
oh	1
take	1
those	1
off	1
those	1
she	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
spectacles	1
pierre	1
took	1
them	1
off	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
besides	1
the	1
strange	1
look	1
eyes	1
have	1
from	1
which	1
spectacles	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
removed	1
had	1
also	1
a	1
frightened	1
and	1
inquiring	1
look	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
stoop	1
over	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
kiss	1
it	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
almost	1
brutal	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
she	1
intercepted	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
met	1
them	1
with	1
her	1

he	1
said	1
remembering	1
what	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
at	1
such	1
moments	1
but	1
his	1
words	1
sounded	1
so	1
weak	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1

a	1

from	1

announcing	1
that	1

of	1

an	1
extra	1
seventy	1

my	1

me	1
on	1
his	1

so	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
him	1
personally	1
to	1
express	1
the	1
deep	1
respect	1
that	1
emulating	1
his	1
father	1
he	1
feels	1
for	1
you	1

nothing	1
a	1
fortnight	1
after	1
the	1

servants	1
came	1
one	1
evening	1
in	1

he	1

his	1
son	1
arrived	1
next	1
day	1
old	1
bolknski	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
poor	1
opinion	1
of	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
character	1
but	1
more	1
so	1
recently	1
since	1
in	1
the	1
new	1

alexander	1
prince	1

contained	1
in	1

given	1
by	1
the	1
little	1

he	1
saw	1
which	1
way	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
blowing	1
and	1
his	1
low	1
opinion	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
contemptuous	1
ill	1
will	1
he	1
snorted	1
whenever	1
he	1
mentioned	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
arrival	1
prince	1
bolknski	1

out	1
of	1

whether	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
temper	1
because	1
prince	1
vasli	1
was	1
coming	1
or	1
whether	1
his	1
being	1
in	1

made	1
him	1
specially	1
annoyed	1
at	1
prince	1

in	1

at	1

the	1

in	1
his	1
velvet	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
sable	1
collar	1

went	1
out	1
for	1
his	1
usual	1
walk	1
it	1
had	1
snowed	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
the	1
path	1
to	1
the	1
hothouse	1
along	1
which	1
the	1

was	1
in	1
the	1

of	1

swept	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
the	1

sticking	1
in	1

of	1
the	1
soft	1
snowbanks	1
that	1
bordered	1

frowning	1

silent	1

his	1

bowed	1
his	1

went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
god	1
be	1
thanked	1
thought	1
the	1
overseer	1
the	1
storm	1

blown	1
over	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
hard	1
to	1

up	1
your	1

added	1
i	1
heard	1
your	1
honor	1
that	1
a	1
minister	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
visit	1
your	1
honor	1
the	1
prince	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
the	1

fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
him	1
frowning	1
what	1
a	1
minister	1
what	1
minister	1
who	1
gave	1
orders	1
he	1

in	1
his	1
shrill	1
harsh	1
voice	1
the	1
road	1

not	1
swept	1
for	1
the	1

for	1

there	1

shouted	1
the	1

his	1
words	1
coming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
rapidly	1
and	1
indistinctly	1
you	1
thought	1
rascals	1
blackguards	1
ill	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
stick	1
he	1
swung	1
it	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
hit	1
alptych	1
the	1

had	1
not	1
the	1

instinctively	1
avoided	1
the	1

although	1
alptych	1
frightened	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
temerity	1
in	1
avoiding	1
the	1
stroke	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
bowing	1
his	1
bald	1
head	1
resignedly	1
before	1
him	1
or	1
perhaps	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
the	1

he	1
continued	1
to	1
shout	1
blackguards	1
throw	1
the	1
snow	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
road	1

in	1
a	1
bad	1
humor	1
stood	1
awaiting	1

mademoiselle	1

with	1
a	1
radiant	1
face	1
that	1
said	1

nothing	1

as	1

and	1
princess	1
mary	1
pale	1
frightened	1
and	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes	1
what	1
she	1
found	1
hardest	1
to	1
bear	1
was	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
on	1
such	1
occasions	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
behave	1
like	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
she	1
thought	1
if	1
i	1
seem	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
he	1
will	1
think	1
that	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
sympathize	1
with	1
him	1
if	1
i	1
seem	1
sad	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
spirits	1
myself	1
he	1
will	1
say	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
before	1
that	1
im	1
in	1
the	1
dumps	1
the	1
prince	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
daughters	1
frightened	1
face	1
and	1
snorted	1
fool	1
or	1
dummy	1
he	1
muttered	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
is	1
not	1
here	1
theyve	1

telling	1
tales	1

asked	1

well	1
answered	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1

she	1
wont	1
come	1
down	1

natural	1
in	1
her	1
state	1
hm	1
hm	1
muttered	1
the	1
prince	1
sitting	1
down	1
his	1
plate	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
not	1
quite	1
clean	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
spot	1
he	1
flung	1
it	1
away	1
tkhon	1
caught	1
it	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
footman	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
was	1
not	1
unwell	1
but	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
overpowering	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
hearing	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
humor	1
she	1
had	1
decided	1
not	1
to	1
appear	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
for	1
the	1
baby	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
heaven	1
knows	1
what	1
a	1
fright	1
might	1
do	1
in	1
general	1
at	1
bald	1
hills	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
lived	1
in	1
constant	1
fear	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
antipathy	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
because	1
the	1
fear	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
stronger	1
feeling	1
the	1
prince	1
reciprocated	1
this	1
antipathy	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
overpowered	1
by	1
his	1
contempt	1
for	1
her	1
when	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
grown	1
accustomed	1
to	1
life	1
at	1
bald	1
hills	1
she	1
took	1
a	1
special	1
fancy	1
to	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
spent	1
whole	1
days	1
with	1
her	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
often	1
talked	1
with	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
criticized	1
him	1
so	1
we	1
are	1
to	1

mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
unsuccessful	1
in	1
her	1
choice	1
of	1
a	1
subject	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
talking	1
but	1
chattered	1
about	1
the	1
conservatories	1
and	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
a	1
flower	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
opened	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
soup	1
the	1
prince	1
became	1
more	1
genial	1
after	1
dinner	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
daughterinlaw	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
a	1
small	1

with	1

her	1
maid	1
she	1
grew	1
pale	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
fatherinlaw	1
she	1
was	1
much	1
altered	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
plain	1
rather	1
than	1
pretty	1
her	1
cheeks	1
had	1
sunk	1
her	1
lip	1
was	1
drawn	1
up	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
drawn	1
down	1
yes	1
i	1
feel	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
oppression	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
princes	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
she	1
felt	1
do	1
you	1

well	1
all	1
right	1
all	1
right	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
waiting	1
room	1
where	1
alptych	1
stood	1
with	1
bowed	1
head	1
has	1
the	1
snow	1
been	1
shoveled	1
back	1
yes	1
your	1
excellency	1

for	1
heavens	1
sake	1

was	1
only	1
my	1
stupidity	1
all	1
right	1
all	1
right	1
interrupted	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
laughing	1
his	1
unnatural	1
way	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
alptych	1
to	1
kiss	1
and	1
then	1
proceeded	1
to	1
his	1
study	1
prince	1
vasli	1
arrived	1
that	1
evening	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
avenue	1
by	1
coachmen	1
and	1
footmen	1
who	1
with	1
loud	1
shouts	1
dragged	1
his	1
sleighs	1
up	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lodges	1
over	1
the	1
road	1
purposely	1
laden	1
with	1
snow	1
prince	1
vasli	1
and	1
anatole	1
had	1
separate	1
rooms	1
assigned	1
to	1
them	1
anatole	1
having	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
overcoat	1
sat	1
with	1
arms	1
akimbo	1
before	1
a	1
table	1
on	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
smilingly	1
and	1
absentmindedly	1
fixed	1
his	1
large	1
and	1
handsome	1
eyes	1
he	1
regarded	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
as	1
a	1
continual	1
round	1
of	1
amusement	1
which	1
someone	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
had	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
this	1
visit	1
to	1
a	1
churlish	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
rich	1
and	1
ugly	1
heiress	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
all	1
this	1
might	1
he	1
thought	1
turn	1
out	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
amusingly	1
and	1
why	1
not	1
marry	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
really	1
has	1
so	1
much	1
money	1
that	1
never	1
does	1
any	1
harm	1
thought	1
anatole	1
he	1
shaved	1
and	1
scented	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
care	1
and	1
elegance	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
habitual	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
handsome	1
head	1
held	1
high	1
entered	1
his	1
fathers	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
goodhumored	1
and	1
victorious	1
air	1
natural	1
to	1
him	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
two	1
valets	1
were	1
busy	1
dressing	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
much	1
animation	1
and	1
cheerfully	1
nodded	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
as	1
the	1
latter	1
entered	1
as	1
if	1

a	1
conversation	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
often	1
been	1
mentioned	1
during	1
the	1
journey	1
enough	1
what	1
nonsense	1
above	1
all	1
try	1
to	1
be	1
respectful	1
and	1
cautious	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
if	1
he	1
starts	1
a	1
row	1
ill	1
go	1
away	1

on	1

in	1
the	1
meantime	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
it	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
maidservants	1
rooms	1
that	1
the	1
minister	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
arrived	1
but	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
both	1
had	1
been	1
minutely	1
described	1
princess	1
mary	1
was	1
sitting	1
alone	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
vainly	1
trying	1
to	1
master	1
her	1
agitation	1
why	1
did	1
they	1
write	1
why	1
did	1
lise	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
it	1
it	1
can	1
never	1
happen	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
how	1
shall	1
i	1
enter	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
even	1
if	1
i	1
like	1
him	1
i	1
cant	1
now	1
be	1
myself	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
mere	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
fathers	1
look	1
filled	1
her	1
with	1
terror	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
and	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
had	1
already	1
received	1
from	1
msha	1
the	1
ladys	1
maid	1
the	1
necessary	1
report	1
of	1
how	1
handsome	1
the	1
ministers	1
son	1
was	1
with	1
his	1
rosy	1
cheeks	1
and	1
dark	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
difficulty	1
the	1
father	1
had	1
dragged	1
his	1
legs	1
upstairs	1
while	1
the	1
son	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
like	1
an	1
eagle	1
three	1
steps	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
having	1
received	1
this	1
information	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
and	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
whose	1
chattering	1
voices	1
had	1
reached	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
corridor	1
went	1
into	1
princess	1
marys	1
room	1
you	1
know	1
theyve	1
come	1
marie	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
waddling	1
in	1
and	1
sinking	1
heavily	1
into	1
an	1
armchair	1
she	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
loose	1
gown	1
she	1
generally	1
wore	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
but	1
had	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
best	1
dresses	1
her	1
hair	1
was	1
carefully	1
done	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
animated	1
which	1
however	1
did	1
not	1
conceal	1
its	1
sunken	1
and	1
faded	1
outlines	1
dressed	1
as	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
petersburg	1
society	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
noticeable	1
how	1
much	1
plainer	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
some	1
unobtrusive	1
touch	1
had	1
been	1
added	1
to	1
mademoiselle	1
bouriennes	1
toilet	1
which	1
rendered	1
her	1
fresh	1
and	1
pretty	1
face	1
yet	1
more	1
attractive	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
remain	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
dear	1
princess	1
she	1
began	1
theyll	1
be	1
announcing	1
that	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
smartened	1
yourself	1
up	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
got	1
up	1
rang	1
for	1
the	1
maid	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
merrily	1
began	1
to	1
devise	1
and	1
carry	1
out	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
how	1
princess	1
mary	1
should	1
be	1
dressed	1
princess	1
marys	1
selfesteem	1
was	1
wounded	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
a	1
suitor	1
agitated	1
her	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
so	1
by	1
both	1
her	1
companions	1
not	1
having	1
the	1
least	1
conception	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
otherwise	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
for	1
herself	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
betray	1
her	1
agitation	1
while	1
to	1
decline	1
their	1
offers	1
to	1
dress	1
her	1
would	1
prolong	1
their	1
banter	1
and	1
insistence	1
she	1
flushed	1
her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
grew	1
dim	1
red	1
blotches	1
came	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
it	1
took	1
on	1
the	1
unattractive	1
martyrlike	1
expression	1
it	1
so	1
often	1
wore	1
as	1
she	1
submitted	1
herself	1
to	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
and	1
lise	1
both	1
these	1
women	1
quite	1
sincerely	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
look	1
pretty	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
plain	1
that	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
rival	1
so	1
they	1
began	1
dressing	1
her	1
with	1
perfect	1
sincerity	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
nave	1
and	1
firm	1
conviction	1
women	1
have	1
that	1
dress	1
can	1
make	1
a	1
face	1
pretty	1
no	1
really	1
my	1
dear	1
this	1
dress	1
is	1
not	1
pretty	1
said	1
lise	1
looking	1
sideways	1
at	1
princess	1
mary	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
distance	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
maroon	1
dress	1
have	1
it	1
fetched	1
really	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
your	1
whole	1
life	1
may	1
be	1
at	1
stake	1
but	1
this	1
one	1
is	1
too	1
light	1
its	1
not	1
becoming	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
dress	1
but	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
whole	1
figure	1
of	1
princess	1
mary	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
pretty	1
but	1
neither	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
nor	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
felt	1
this	1
they	1
still	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
blue	1
ribbon	1
were	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
hair	1
the	1
hair	1
combed	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
blue	1
scarf	1
arranged	1
lower	1
on	1
the	1
best	1
maroon	1
dress	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
they	1
forgot	1
that	1
the	1
frightened	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
figure	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
altered	1
and	1
that	1
however	1
they	1
might	1
change	1
the	1
setting	1
and	1
adornment	1
of	1
that	1
face	1
it	1
would	1
still	1
remain	1
piteous	1
and	1
plain	1
after	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
changes	1
to	1
which	1
princess	1
mary	1
meekly	1
submitted	1
just	1
as	1
her	1
hair	1
had	1
been	1
arranged	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
a	1
style	1
that	1
quite	1
altered	1
and	1
spoiled	1
her	1
looks	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
maroon	1
dress	1
with	1
a	1
paleblue	1
scarf	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
walked	1
twice	1
round	1
her	1
now	1
adjusting	1
a	1
fold	1
of	1
the	1
dress	1
with	1
her	1
little	1

she	1
added	1
smiling	1
with	1
a	1
foretaste	1
of	1
artistic	1
pleasure	1
but	1
when	1
katie	1
brought	1
the	1
required	1
dress	1
princess	1
mary	1
remained	1
sitting	1
motionless	1
before	1
the	1
glass	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
her	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
her	1
mouth	1
quivering	1
ready	1
to	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs	1
come	1
dear	1
princess	1
said	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
just	1
one	1
more	1
little	1
effort	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
taking	1
the	1
dress	1
from	1
the	1

came	1
up	1
to	1
princess	1
mary	1
well	1
now	1
well	1

something	1
quite	1
simple	1
and	1
becoming	1
she	1
said	1
the	1
three	1
voices	1
hers	1
mademoiselle	1
bouriennes	1
and	1
katies	1
who	1
was	1
laughing	1
at	1
something	1
mingled	1
in	1
a	1
merry	1
sound	1
like	1
the	1
chirping	1
of	1
birds	1
no	1
leave	1
me	1
alone	1
said	1
princess	1
mary	1
her	1
voice	1
sounded	1
so	1
serious	1
and	1
so	1
sad	1
that	1
the	1
chirping	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
was	1
silenced	1
at	1
once	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
beautiful	1
large	1
thoughtful	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
of	1
thoughts	1
gazing	1
shiningly	1
and	1
imploringly	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
understood	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
and	1
even	1
cruel	1
to	1
insist	1
at	1
least	1
change	1
your	1
coiffure	1

the	1
little	1

the	1

answered	1
a	1
voice	1
struggling	1
with	1
tears	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
to	1
own	1
to	1
themselves	1
that	1
princess	1
mary	1
in	1
this	1
guise	1
looked	1
very	1
plain	1
worse	1
than	1
usual	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
she	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
them	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
they	1
both	1
knew	1
an	1
expression	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
sad	1
this	1
expression	1
in	1
princess	1
mary	1
did	1
not	1
frighten	1
them	1
she	1
never	1
inspired	1
fear	1
in	1
anyone	1
but	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
it	1
appeared	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
became	1
mute	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
shaken	1
in	1
her	1
determination	1
you	1
will	1
change	1
it	1

she	1
did	1
not	1

with	1

she	1
not	1
only	1
left	1
her	1
hair	1
as	1
it	1
was	1

did	1
not	1
even	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
glass	1
letting	1
her	1

fall	1
helplessly	1
she	1
sat	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes	1

pondered	1
a	1

a	1
man	1
a	1
strong	1
dominant	1
and	1
strangely	1
attractive	1
being	1
rose	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
and	1
carried	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
totally	1
different	1
happy	1
world	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
she	1
fancied	1

moment	1
came	1
the	1

at	1
the	1

she	1
roused	1
herself	1
and	1
felt	1
appalled	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
and	1
before	1
going	1
down	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
icons	1
hung	1
and	1
her	1

fixed	1
on	1
the	1

face	1
of	1
a	1
large	1

of	1
the	1

lit	1
by	1

she	1
stood	1
before	1
it	1
with	1
folded	1

for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
a	1
painful	1
doubt	1
filled	1

her	1
strongest	1

deeply	1

was	1
for	1

from	1

from	1

when	1

came	1
down	1
prince	1
vasli	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
and	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
when	1
she	1
entered	1
with	1
her	1
heavy	1
step	1
treading	1
on	1
her	1
heels	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
mademoiselle	1

the	1
little	1

indicating	1
her	1
to	1
the	1

voil	1
marie	1
princess	1
mary	1
saw	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
in	1
detail	1
she	1
saw	1
prince	1
vaslis	1
face	1
serious	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
immediately	1
smiling	1
again	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
curiously	1
noting	1
the	1
impression	1
marie	1
produced	1
on	1
the	1
visitors	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
with	1
her	1
ribbon	1
and	1
pretty	1
face	1
and	1
her	1
unusually	1
animated	1
look	1
which	1
was	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
but	1
him	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
she	1
only	1
saw	1
something	1
large	1
brilliant	1
and	1
handsome	1
moving	1
toward	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
prince	1
vasli	1
approached	1
first	1
and	1
she	1
kissed	1
the	1
bold	1
forehead	1
that	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
answered	1
his	1
question	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
she	1
remembered	1
him	1
quite	1
well	1
then	1
anatole	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
still	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
she	1
only	1
felt	1
a	1
soft	1
hand	1
taking	1
hers	1
firmly	1
and	1
she	1
touched	1
with	1
her	1
lips	1
a	1
white	1
forehead	1
over	1
which	1
was	1
beautiful	1
lightbrown	1
hair	1
smelling	1
of	1
pomade	1
when	1
she	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
his	1
beauty	1
anatole	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
thumb	1
under	1
a	1
button	1
of	1
his	1
uniform	1
his	1
chest	1
expanded	1
and	1
his	1
back	1
drawn	1
in	1
slightly	1
swinging	1
one	1
foot	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
bent	1
looked	1
with	1
beaming	1
face	1
at	1
the	1
princess	1
without	1
speaking	1
and	1
evidently	1
not	1
thinking	1
about	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
anatole	1
was	1
not	1
quickwitted	1
nor	1
ready	1
or	1
eloquent	1
in	1
conversation	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
faculty	1
so	1
invaluable	1
in	1
society	1
of	1
composure	1
and	1
imperturbable	1
selfpossession	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
lacking	1
in	1
selfconfidence	1
remains	1
dumb	1
on	1
a	1
first	1
introduction	1
and	1
betrays	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
such	1
silence	1
and	1
an	1
anxiety	1
to	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
effect	1
is	1
bad	1
but	1
anatole	1
was	1
dumb	1
swung	1
his	1
foot	1
and	1
smilingly	1
examined	1
the	1
princess	1
hair	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
silent	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
time	1
if	1
anyone	1
finds	1
this	1
silence	1
inconvenient	1
let	1
him	1
talk	1
but	1
i	1
dont	1
want	1
to	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
besides	1
this	1
in	1
his	1
behavior	1
to	1
women	1
anatole	1
had	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
particularly	1
inspires	1
in	1
them	1
curiosity	1
awe	1
and	1
even	1
lovea	1
supercilious	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
superiority	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
but	1
why	1
should	1
i	1
bother	1
about	1
you	1
youd	1
be	1
only	1
too	1
glad	1
of	1
course	1
perhaps	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
really	1
think	1
this	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
womeneven	1
probably	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
in	1
general	1
he	1
thought	1
very	1
littlebut	1
his	1
looks	1
and	1
manner	1
gave	1
that	1
impression	1
the	1
princess	1
felt	1
this	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
dare	1
expect	1
to	1
interest	1
him	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1

the	1

and	1
animated	1

and	1

downy	1
lip	1
that	1
lifted	1
over	1
her	1
white	1
teeth	1
she	1
met	1
prince	1
vasli	1
with	1
that	1
playful	1
manner	1
often	1
employed	1
by	1
lively	1
chatty	1
people	1
and	1
consisting	1
in	1
the	1
assumption	1
that	1
between	1
the	1
person	1
they	1
so	1
address	1
and	1
themselves	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
semiprivate	1
longestablished	1
jokes	1
and	1
amusing	1
reminiscences	1
though	1
no	1
such	1
reminiscences	1
really	1
existjust	1
as	1
none	1
existed	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
prince	1
vasli	1
readily	1
adopted	1
her	1
tone	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
also	1
drew	1
anatole	1
whom	1
she	1
hardly	1
knew	1
into	1
these	1
amusing	1
recollections	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
had	1
never	1
occurred	1
mademoiselle	1
bourienne	1
also	1
shared	1
them	1
